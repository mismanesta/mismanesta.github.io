What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything â€“ a new way of looking at something, coming up with new ways to do something, or coming up with a new idea for a product. There are so many creative ideas out there that it can be hard to know what to choose from. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1) Get inspired by your surroundings. When you're looking for creative ideas, take in the environment around you and try to come up with some ideas for products that would reflect the atmosphere. 
2) Be open to change. If you're not sure what you want your product to look like, don't be afraid to experiment and see what different styles work well for you. 
3) Take time for yourself. It's important to spend time relaxing and focusing on your creativity instead of working on things that are taking up your time.
