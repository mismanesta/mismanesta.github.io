What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything you want them to be. It doesn't have to be something that's necessarily new, but something that will help your business or product stand out. Below are some ideas to get you started:
1. Create a Logo
A logo is the foundation of any business or product. A well- designed and executed logo can help make a company recognizable and sell its products. If you don't have a strong logo, consider hiring someone to create one for you.

2. Come up with a Unique Text Message
Text messages are an effective way to communicate with your customers and promote your business. They're also great for spreading the word about your product or service in a unique way. Find creative ways to send text messages that will resonate with customers and help build relationships with them.

The creative process: How do we go about creating art?
Creative process: how do we go about creating art?
In order to create art, there are a few key stages that must be gone through in order to produce successful pieces. Here are some tips on how to get started: 

1. Understand your purpose or vision for the artwork. Once you have a clear idea of what you want your piece to represent, it’s important to figure out how you want it to look. This can involve designing the layout and graphics yourself, or using free software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. 
2. Be honest with yourself and others. When starting out, it’s important not try to be too artsy or fancy. Just aim to create something that is interesting and engaging for your audience- whether that’s friends, family, or strangers.
