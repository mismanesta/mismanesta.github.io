The definition of an invention: What is it?
Inventions are creations that make things work better or easier than they would without them. They can be physical objects like a car or a computer, or intellectual property like a patent or trade secret. There are many different types of inventions, and the definition of an invention can vary depending on what you're looking for. For example, some people might define an invention as a new product, while others might focus on making something easier or more efficient. This concept is also important to understand when it comes to patenting an invention - not all inventions need to be patented in order for them to be considered an invention.

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals. You can find many different creative ideas online, and there are many ways to use them. Here are some of the best:  
- Creative packaging: Many people think that creativity comes when someone comes up with a new idea for a product or service. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes, creative ideas come from looking at something from a different perspective. For example, if you were to redesign your favorite restaurant’s logo, you might come up with an inventive design that is more eye-catching and efficient than the original. 
- Branding: One of the most important things that businesses do is to create brand equity. This means creating a name for your company and making it known to other businesses in your industry.
