What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.

The impact of ideas
How do ideas shape our world?
From the thoughts in our heads to the products on store shelves, ideas are responsible for everything around us. Every object we interact with was once just an idea in somebody’s head, and every object will one day be replaced by a new idea.

Ideas have always been important, but in today’s fast-paced, globalized world, they are more important than ever before. With technology making it easier than ever to share and develop ideas, the impact of a great idea can be felt almost immediately.

Whether it’s a new way to make money, a better way to make a product, or a new way to solve a problem, the right idea can change everything. And as we continue to face new challenges and opportunities, the power of ideas will only become more evident.
