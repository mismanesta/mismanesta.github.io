Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.

Some people may love the challenge of trying something new, while others may find it difficult to figure out what they're doing wrong the first time around.  So, which option is right for you? Here are seven tips on how to choose the right project for you.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.
