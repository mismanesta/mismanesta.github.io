Invention: How does innovation happen?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new way to do something. Sometimes, this comes about through the sharing of ideas or the discovery of a new resource. Sometimes, it comes about through the development of a new product or service.
In any case, innovation happens in many ways and at different speeds. Here are four examples that illustrate how: 

1) Invention often happens spontaneously - people will often come up with ideas for new products or services while they are still working on other projects. 
2) Invention can be slow - sometimes it takes years for someone to develop a new product or service that is really useful. 
3) Invention can be fast - sometimes people can come up with ideas for products and services in minutes or even seconds.

Solutions: How to fix a problem with a tool or project?
There are many ways to fix a problem with tools or projects, but some solutions are more trouble than they're worth. Here are five tips to help avoid common problems with tools and projects:
1. Check the tool's documentation before using it. Many tools come with extensive user manuals that can answer any questions you have about them. Make sure to read these before starting the project.

2. Be familiar with the tool's features and limitations. most tools come with comprehensive detailed documentation, but not all of them do justice to their features and limitations. Be patient and test the tool until you see how it behaves in practice. This will help you determine whether the tool is worth your time and money.

3. Be aware of potential glitches early on in the project.
