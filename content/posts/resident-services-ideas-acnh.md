Top 5 priorities when renovating or upgrading: What are some things you should consider before starting any renovation project?
Renovating or upgrading your home can seem daunting, but with some easy diy ideas and a bit of creativity, it can be a breeze. Here are five top priorities when renovating or upgrading: 
1. Choose the right renovation project: The first step is to choose the right renovation project for your needs. Do you want to update your home for its next generation or restore it to its former glory? There are many options and consequences to each decision, so consult with a professional before starting any renovation. 
2. Get pre-approved: Once you've chosen the project you want to undertake, it's time to get pre-approved from your local building authority or other approvals required for the type of renovation you want to do. This way, you'll know exactly what permits and regulations will be necessary in order to complete the project without any surprises later on.
