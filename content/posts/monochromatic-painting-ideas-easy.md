The future of innovation is exciting, but it also has a lot of potential drawbacks. Many experts believe that innovation can be used to create new products and services that are more efficient, more affordable, or even more dangerous. However, these benefits often come with a cost – the creativity and ingenuity of the innovator is often required to come up with new ideas that can save people time, money, or even lives. If this process is not done right, the innovation could instead lead to danger and disaster.
