The drawbacks of brainstorming
There are many drawbacks to brainstorming. Brainstorming can lead to groupthink, which is when a group of people come up with ideas that are not very creative or innovative because they all think alike. This can happen because people in the group feel pressure to conform to the majority opinion. Another problem with brainstorming is that it can be very inefficient. A lot of time can be wasted coming up with ideas that are not good, and it can be hard to come up with new ideas if you are stuck on one bad idea. Finally, brainstorming can sometimes create conflict within a group because people may have different opinions about the best way to solve a problem.

What are the options for ideas?
Ideas are a valuable asset for businesses and individuals. They can be used to generate new ideas, come up with new products or services, or come up with new ways of doing things. Unfortunately, not every idea is a good one. Sometimes ideas are just too crazy or too innovative for the marketplace to take on. There are two ways to overcome this obstacle: 1) Find a market for your idea and 2) Make sure your idea is something that the market wants.
