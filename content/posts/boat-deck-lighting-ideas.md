How can innovation be used to improve businesses?
Innovation is a key element of business success. It can be used to improve businesses by providing new and unique solutions to problems, or by creating new ways to do business. There are several ways that innovation can be used in business, but some of the most common are: 
1. Innovation can help businesses increase sales and profits. When businesses use innovation to create new products or services that are more successful than those available before, they can make more money and achieve their goals more quickly.

This is especially important for small businesses, which may not have the resources or budget to spend on large-scale innovations. 
3. Innovation can help businesses improve customer service.
