Definition of art: The process of creating a piece of art
As somebody who spends a great deal of time creating art, it's important to have a clear definition for what art is. Whether you're talking about creative writing, painting, or sculpture, there are some commonalities that all art possess. So without further ado, here's the definition for art: 
1. Art is the process of creating something that has value and can be appreciated by others.
2. Art requires an artist to put their own feelings and emotions into their work, which can make it sometimes difficult to see how it could be seen as anything other than pure creativity.

Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.

Section 3: The benefits of Diy.
Diy Ideas For The Busy Person
You're always busy and don't have time for anything. But what if we told you that there are benefits to Diy-ing? Yes, it's true! Here are three benefits of taking on a Do It Yourself project:

1. It can save you money. When you do things yourself, you don't have to pay someone else to do it for you. This means that you can put that money towards something else - like your savings or retirement account.

2. It can be therapeutic. Doing something with your hands can be very calming and satisfying. It can help take your mind off of your stressful day-to-day life and give you a sense of accomplishment when you finish a project.

3. It can be a bonding experience.
