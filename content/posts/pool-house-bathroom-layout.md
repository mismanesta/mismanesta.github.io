Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other concepts?
Innovation is the process of creating something new and different from what has been done before. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new product, service, or idea that is better than what was available before. Innovation can be found in everything from fashion to technology to business.
If you think about it, innovation is pretty much just a way to make things better. After all, if there was nothing new or different out there to work with, how would anyone ever come up with a new idea? In fact, innovation often comes from coming up with an idea that nobody else has thought of before. So while it may seem like a pretty big responsibility, it's actually quite easy to get started on when you have some basic ideas about what you're looking for.

The challenges of innovation: What needs to be done to make it successful?
Innovation is key to keeping businesses on the right track, but it can also be difficult to get started. Here are four challenges that need to be overcome in order for innovation to stay successful: 1) Lack of experience: Many businesses start out with little or no experience in their field. Without a good foundation, it can be hard to build on what has been done before. This often results in poor innovation and product development. 2) Poor communication: When trying to come up with new ideas, it can be difficult to communicate these effectively and efficiently. This can lead to problems such as miscommunication and confusion over what is being discussed. 3) Lack of coordination: In order for innovation to work well, it needs to be coordinated between different departments within a company. This can be difficult when there are different interests and goals at play.
