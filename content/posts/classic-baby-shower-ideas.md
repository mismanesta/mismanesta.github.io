Aftermath: What you should do if your DIY project fails
If you're like many people, you probably think of DIY projects as something that's easy and fun. But if your project fails, you should do some research on what to do next. For example, if your project involves a DIY floor lamp, make sure the wiring is correct before trying to install the lamp. If you've never built any kind of project before, it's important to get help from a family member or friend who can provide tips on how to fix a problem.

motion picture technology: What were some of the advances?
Invention ideas for motion picture technology include new ways to create realistic graphics and sound, and more efficient filming techniques. Some of the advances that have been made in this field include: 
- Virtual reality: In a recent study, virtual reality headsets were used to film a movie set in another world. The experience was incredibly realistic, and allowed for a much deeper level of immersion than traditional movies. 

- 3D printing: This technology is being used to create detailed models of objects and characters within films, as well as creating costumes and sets. It has the potential to create much higher quality final products than traditional manufacturing processes. 

- Augmented reality: This technology uses computer software to project digital images onto real or other surfaces. These images can be used to help actors perform scenes more accurately, or even provide clues about the story itself.
