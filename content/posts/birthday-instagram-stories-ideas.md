Idea 3: Give people the freedom to experiment.
A recent study by a team at the University of California, San Diego suggests that giving people the freedom to experiment may be key to solving some of society’s most pressing problems. The study, conducted with the help of a grant from the National Institutes of Health, surveyed more than 4,000 people in 20 different countries and found that those who had greater access to freedom were more likely to engage in creative forms of problem-solving. The researchers say their findings could lead to new ways to solve problems and spur innovation.

The State of Invention Today
Invention is a vital part of our economy and society. Yet, it has been difficult to keep up with the growth of invention. Inventions have become more common, but the number of new ideas remains low. This lack of innovation is costing society billions of dollars each year in lost revenue and jobs.
Despite these costs, there is still a lot that we can learn from the history of invention. For example, some inventions were originally created for no other purpose than to solve a problem. Other inventions were made just for fun or as an experiment. But even the simplest inventions can have big consequences. For example, the Telephone was invented to make communication more efficient and cost-effective. Today, it plays an important role in our lives and economy.

There are several ways to help rise awareness about Invention and keep it alive.

The golden rule for getting ideas: You have to be passionate about it
Ideas are a lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we may as well be living in a cave. However, if you're not passionate about your ideas, you'll likely never get very far with them. So how do you get started? The key is to be passionate about your idea and to continue to develop it over time. If you can focus on what you're passionate about and keep pushing yourself, eventually your ideas will improve and you'll be on your way to becoming a great thinker.

How to turn creative ideas into reality
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but sometimes they can turn into something really great. Here are four tips to help you turn your creative ideas into reality:
1. Have a vision. Without a clear vision, it’s tough to put together an idea that will work. Make sure your idea is based on something you care about and have passion for.

2. Get feedback. Take the time to get feedback from people who know what you’re talking about. Not only will this help you ensure your idea is accurate, but it can also give you some great ideas to work with.

3. Make it simple and achievable. If it’s too difficult or challenging to come up with an idea, chances are it won’t be successful.

The three types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, and Exact
Creativity is a result of the interaction between two or more factors. These factors can be called intuition and analysis, or exactly. Intuitive creativity is the result of an individual's natural ability to connect with the world and see patterns. Analytical creativity is founded on reason and analysis, which can help individuals see how things work and how they can be improved. 
Exact creativity is when an individual has a specific idea and they go into deep analysis to make it a reality. This type of creativity often requires focus and dedication, as it can be difficult to change your mind after you have initial ideas. However, if done correctly, this type of creativity can lead to amazing products and solutions.
