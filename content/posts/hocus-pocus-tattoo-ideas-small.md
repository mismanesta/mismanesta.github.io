The dangers of big ideas
Most people think of big ideas as being a good thing. After all, they’re the things that change the world. But there is a downside to having big ideas. They can be dangerous.
For one thing, big ideas are often disruptive. They can upend established ways of doing things and create chaos in the process. That’s not always a bad thing, but it can be. And even when it leads to positive change, it can be difficult and painful for those who are caught in the middle of it.

Another danger of big ideas is that they can be overwhelming. When we’re faced with a big problem, it can be tempting to try to solve it with a single, grand solution. But that rarely works out well. Complex problems usually require multiple smaller solutions working together.
