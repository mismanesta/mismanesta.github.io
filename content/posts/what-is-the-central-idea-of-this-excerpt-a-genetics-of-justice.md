The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

The Process of Invention: What goes into creating a new invention?
Invention can be defined as the process by which a new idea, product or service is created. It starts with the seed of an idea and ends with the final product or service. Key ingredients in the process of invention include creativity, problem solving and collaboration. The process can be time-consuming and expensive, but when it works well it can be exhilarating. Here are four tips for putting your best foot forward when creating a new invention: 1. Take your time – don’t rush your Invention. Even if it takes a little longer than you’d like, taking your time will help you stay organized and focused on your project. 2. Be open to feedback – Get feedback from potential customers, employees or others who may have an impact on how your Invention turns out.
