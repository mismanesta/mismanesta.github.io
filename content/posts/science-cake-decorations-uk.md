There are a few reasons why an idea can become something real. Maybe it's because it has the potential to solve a problem people have been dealing with for years, or maybe it's got the potential to change the way people live their lives.

The benefits of creativity: How can it be used?
Creativity is a valuable tool that can be used to solve problems and create new ideas. There are many benefits to creativity, including making new friends, developing new skills, and increasing your productivity. Here are three ways creativity can be used in your life: 
1. Create original ideas: When you have an idea for a product or project, start by thinking about how you could make it better or more unique. Try to come up with a solution that nobody else has thought of before. This can be really helpful in getting started on a project or finding a solution to a problem.

2. Make connections: When you make new friends, it can be really helpful to get out and talk about your interests. It can also be fun to meet others who share the same interests as you do. This will help you develop relationships that are beneficial both professionally and personally.
