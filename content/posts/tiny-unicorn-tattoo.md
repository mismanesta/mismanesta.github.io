Uses for inventions: What can you do with an invention?
Inventions offer a new way to do something, make a product or change the way we live. They can be helpful in many ways, from improving safety to solving problems we face every day. Sometimes an invention can be used for its own sake - like a new phone case that protects your phone - but other times an inventor might create an invention for a company or organization, hoping to improve their product or service. Here are some examples of how inventions have been used in the past: 
-An inventor created the first airbag system that saved lives on a highway in 1937.
-An inventor developed the global positioning system (GPS) in the 1990s so drivers could find their way around without having to look at Maps.
-Inventionists have created numerous devices and appliances since the turn of the century, such as solar chargers and anxiety pills.

The difference between creative and non-creative art: What makes one more creative than the other?
Creative art is often seen as something that is more "creative" than non-creative. This may be based on the individual's creative skills or simply their preferences. There are a few key elements to creative art, which can make it more creative than non-creative: 1) The artist has a passion for their work and feels an intense connection to it. This can be seen in the artist's eyes when they're creating, and it shows in their work as a whole. 2) The artist uses their creativity to explore new ideas, or come up with new ways of existing within the world. Non-creative artists may only focus on what they know, and may not explore any new ideas or different perspectives.

What are some common mistakes people make when trying tobrainstrom?
When trying tobrainstrom, some common mistakes people make include not learning from their mistakes, thinking they know what they are doing, and underestimating the power of positive thinking. To help you avoid making these mistakes, here are a few tips: 1. First and foremost, be honest with yourself – ask yourself what specifically made you do something wrong the last time you tried brainstroming. If you can't answer this question, it's probably best not to try it again. Knowing your weaknesses will help you focus on attacking them rather than letting them sit there stagnant. 2. Next, work on your practice skills – if you're someone who struggles with problem-solving or strategy development, make sure to practice these skills regularly. This way, when you finally get started with brainstroming, you'll be well-prepared and comfortable starting out.
