Tips for Working creatively: What to keep in mind?
Creative ideas can come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something new and beautiful. Here are a few tips to help you keep your creative juices flowing:

2. Don’t hesitate to take risks – if something seems too risky, let it be. The important thing is that you don’t give up on your project until it’s finished, or until you find a better way to do it.
