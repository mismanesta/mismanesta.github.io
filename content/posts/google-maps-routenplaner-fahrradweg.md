It can be something as simple as a new way to make your existing product work, or something even more amazing such as the invention of the printing press.

Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.

What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas, products, or services that are different from what is already out there. It can also be seen as the change that occurs in the way we use and think about things. Innovation is often seen as something good, like new ways to make our food or clothes. However, sometimes innovation can also be bad, like a new way of advertising that isn't effective.
