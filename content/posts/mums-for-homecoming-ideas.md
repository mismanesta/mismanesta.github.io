What is brainstroming?
Are you finding it hard to focus on your work? Are you feeling overwhelmed by all the information you have to remember? If so, you might be experiencing brainstroming, or an intense focus on one task that is preventing you from completing other tasks. Brainstroming is a common problem and can lead to a loss of time and productivity. Here are some tips to help keep your mind active and focused: 
-Set specific goals for yourself and work towards them as closely as possible. This will help keep your focus on task and not onfailed goals. 
-Keep a positive attitude when working with new information. This will help prevent brainstroming and allow you to pay more attention to the task at hand. 
-Stay organized by creating lists of information, breaking down complex concepts into manageable chunks, and tracking progress.
