What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and useful products or services. Innovation can be found in both traditional businesses and startups. A business that is constantly innovating will likely have a higher chance for success than one that is not as innovative. In order to be successful, a business must provide value to its customers and compete with other companies on a regular basis. A startup, on the other hand, does not have the same constraints as a traditional company and can often be more creative in their product development.

Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.

Origins of Invention: How did people come up with ideas for new products and services?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or service that has not been tried before. It can be an idea for a new toy, a new way to make your product or service more marketable, or even a new way to do your business.
