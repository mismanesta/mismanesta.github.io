4 easy ways to declutter your home
decluttering your home can be a lot of fun and it can help you save money. Here are four easy ways to declutter your home:
1. Get organized. Make sure all of your belongings are in one place and organized according to what type of item it is. This will make it easier to find what you need and move things around when you need to.

2. Get rid of excess clutter. It may seem like every time you take a look at your home, there’s more stuff than ever before, but that’s not the case! Remove any unnecessary items from your home that don’t have a use or purpose anymore. This will free up space and help you save money on your housing costs.

3. Use Craigslist or other online directories for recommendations on deals on new or used furniture and decorations.

Patent trends: What are some of the latest patent trends?
Patents are a valuable source of intellectual property. They can protect your ideas and inventions from being copied or used without your permission. However, it's important to be aware of thelatest patent trends so you can stay ahead of any potential infringements. Here are some key points to keep in mind: 
1. Inventor protection claims are getting more common. 
2. Patent applications are coming in larger numbers, and they're more complex than ever before. 
3. The number of patents granted is also increasing, but there's still a lot of competition for the same rights and permissions. 
4. There's a growing trend of using Previously Unpublished Data (PUD) in patent applications. This allows inventors to use data that they've already filed with other companies but which they haven't been able to disclose until now.
