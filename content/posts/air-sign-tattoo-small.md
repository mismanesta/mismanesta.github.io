How to be a better artist: Tips and techniques from experienced artists
Creative art is a process of creating things that are not generally found in the normal world. Artists must use their creativity to come up with new ideas and concepts, and then put them into practice on canvas or paper. There are many ways to become a better artist, and there are plenty of resources available to help you along the way. Here are some tips from experienced artists to help you get started: 
1. Find a creative outlet for your creative impulses. One way to be more creative is by spending time in your own home or office, without any distractions. This will allow you to work on things that interest you without any pressure from others.

Types of creativity: Intuition, inspiration, and reason.
Creativity is a spectrum. From the simple to the complex, there are many different ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition, inspiration, and reason are three of the most common ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition is when you don’t have any specific information about how something should look or feel, and inspiration comes from your own ideas or memories. Reason comes from knowing why something exists and what it has done for other people or things in the past. These three forms of creativity can all be used interchangeably, but they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Intuition is often used to create new ideas, while inspiration helps you see what has already been done and why it was successful. Reason is often used to find solutions to problems, while intuition can be used for more creative thinking outside of the box.
