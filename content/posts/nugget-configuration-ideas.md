Types of creativity: Abstract, Functional, Symbolic.
Creative arts are any art that is based on the creative process. These artists use their creativity to create something new and original. Creative arts can be found in all genres, but some are more popular than others. There are several different types of creative arts, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
Functional art is often seen as the most creative type of creative art. It is based on simply completing a task or completing a goal. Functional artists are usually able to see the world in a specific way and they don’t need much inspiration to create their work. This type of artist often relies on intuition and common sense rather than studying or learning from others.

 Symbolic art is often seen as the second most creative type of artistic creation. This type of artist uses symbols to represent ideas or concepts that they want to communicate through their artwork.
