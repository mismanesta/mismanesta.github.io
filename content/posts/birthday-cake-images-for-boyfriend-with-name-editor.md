Conclusion: The Benefits of Innovation
Innovation is critical to success in today’s economy. By definition, innovation is the introduction of something new – whether it’s a new product, service, process or business model. And while some businesses are born innovative, others have to work hard to embed a culture of innovation into their organization.
