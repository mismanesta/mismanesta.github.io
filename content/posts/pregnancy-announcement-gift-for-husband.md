What are the options for ideas?
Ideas are a valuable asset for businesses and individuals. They can be used to generate new ideas, come up with new products or services, or come up with new ways of doing things. Unfortunately, not every idea is a good one. Sometimes ideas are just too crazy or too innovative for the marketplace to take on. There are two ways to overcome this obstacle: 1) Find a market for your idea and 2) Make sure your idea is something that the market wants.

The different types of ideas
Ideas can be classified by how they are approached. There are three main types of ideas: problem, solution, and goal. Problem ideas come up with a unique solution that solves the problem at hand. Solution ideas come up with a new way of doing something that solves the problem, but may not be what was originally proposed. Goal ideas are the final solution to a problem or goal. They come up with a specific plan or destination that is aimed at getting somewhere else.
