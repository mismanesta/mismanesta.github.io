The definition of art: What are the key factors that influence its definition?

1. A deep connection to the individual audience or subject matter.
2. An ability to evoke strong emotions in the viewer or listener.
3. Uniquely configured elements or techniques that create an original experience.
4. A style that is not easily reproduced or adapted without significant additional work or creativity required from the artist.
