What are some bad ideas?
New ideas can be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on how they're executed. Here are some bad ideas that could lead to negative outcomes: 
1. A new law that restricts freedom of speech. This law could lead to people being arrested and/or fined for expressing their opinions out of fear of retribution from the government. 
2. A plan to close all schools in the city in order to provide more public education. This plan would deprive children of instruction and would lead to an increase in crime rates in the city. 
3. Requiring businesses owners to install security cameras inside their businesses in order to catch thieves and criminals. This would require owners to spend money on something that isn't necessary and would also create an inconvenience for customers who need access to their businesses without having their business broken into.
