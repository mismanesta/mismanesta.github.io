Marketing: How to market your invention idea
Assuming you have an invention idea and want to market it, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it's important to do your research and understand both the industry and your potential customers. Who is your target market? What needs does your product address? How does your product compare to other similar products on the market? Once you have a solid understanding of these things, you can begin developing a marketing strategy.
There are a number of ways to go about marketing your invention idea. One option is to sell directly to companies who may be interested in manufacturing or distributing your product. Another option is to work with an invention marketing firm who can help you patent and protect your idea and then market it to potential buyers. Whichever route you choose, be sure to put together a strong pitch that highlights the need for your product and how it benefits consumers.

Aesthetics: How people perceive art and how it affects them.
Creative art is all around us. Whether you're looking at a painting in a museum, or just taking a walk around your city, you'll see something beautiful. However, how people perceive creative art and how it affects them can differ greatly. For example, some people might see the beauty in the simplicity of a piece of art, while others might be turned off by formal or complex styles. The important thing is that everyone can enjoy creative art, regardless of their viewing preferences.
