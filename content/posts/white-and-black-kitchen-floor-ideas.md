Invention Ideas: How to Be More Creative and Inventive
When it comes to being creative, there are a few things you can do to help yourself become more inventive. First, take some time to brainstorm. Get a piece of paper and a pen, and start jotting down whatever comes to mind. Don't censor yourself; just let the ideas flow. Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. What do they have in common? What are their differences?

Another helpful tip is to try something new. Be open to exploring different activities, hobbies, and interests. This will help broaden your perspective and give you more fodder for your brainstorming sessions. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment. The best way to come up with new ideas is to play around with the ones you already have.

History of invention: How has innovation been used throughout history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to create something. This includes both the simple things like making tools or buildings, and more complex items like air travel or computers. Inventions have had a direct impact on the way we live and work, as well as the way society functions. 
Here are three examples of some of the most famous inventions in human history: 

1) The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1455, which allowed for the spread of literacy and knowledge across cultures. 
2) The Concorde class jet airliner was developed by British Airways in 1969, which made air travel much more affordable and practical.

A few examples of creative work
Creative ideas are nothing new to us, but they can be found in a variety of forms. Sometimes they come from simple things, like when someone comes up with a new way to do something, or when someone comes up with an innovative solution to a problem. Other times, creative ideas come from more complex solutions that require some extra thought and effort. But no matter what the form, creativity is always welcome and appreciated.
