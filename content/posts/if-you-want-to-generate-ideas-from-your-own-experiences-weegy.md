Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is a critical component of any creative organization. Whether itâ€™s a small business, an artist, or a team of creatives, creativity is essential to making anything happen. There are many types of creativity, but three that are most important to businesses and artists alike are visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic. 
Visual creativity refers to the ability to see something and create ideas based on that. This can be done through drawing or painting, but often starts with seeing the idea in your head and then coming up with ways to turn it into a reality. Auditory creativity comes from creating sounds and melodies based on what you hear. This can be done through music creation or sound engineering, but often starts with imagining how the sound could be used in an application or project. Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the ability to touch something and create ideas based on that.

Why is innovation important?
Innovation is important because it drives economic growth. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of a product to the most complex algorithms. It enables businesses to create new products and services that meet customer needs, and it also allows them to stay ahead of their competition.
But innovation isn't just about making new products or services; it's also about creating new ways for businesses to do their work. This may seem like a relatively small detail, but it could provide the company with an edge over its competitors. For example, imagine a business that is able to create custom-made shoes Made in America. That company would be much more likely to be successful than one that relies on global production methods.

Innovation is also important because it helps companies keep up with changing technology.

Creative Process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come to us in all shapes and forms - they can be things we never even thought of, or something that was sitting at the back of our mind but we just couldn't seem to get started on.
Whatever the creative process is, it involves some kind of brainstorming or problem solving. Once you've come up with a few ideas, it's important to work on those ideas until you have a good one. And then it's onto the next step - finding a way to put those ideas into action.
