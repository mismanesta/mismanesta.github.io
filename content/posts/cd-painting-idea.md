What are some creative methods?
Creative methods can be anything from painting to sculpting, but they all have one common goal: to help you achieve your creative goals. Here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Get organized: When it comes to creative endeavors, organization is key. Not only will this help you keep track of what you’re working on, but it can also inspire you to come up with new ideas. Try keeping a binder or portfolio around with all of your creative works, as well as any sketches, paintings, or sculptures that you may have created in the past. 
2. Draw inspiration from nature: One of the best ways to get inspired by your work is to draw inspiration from nature. Not only will this give you a strong grounding in composition and color, but it can also provide inspiration for new ideas and concepts.

Brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a variety of techniques that can be used in order to generate new ideas. One popular technique is known as brainwriting, which involves writing down ideas on paper or in a digital document. This can be done individually or in a group setting.
Another common brainstorming technique is known as mind mapping. This involves creating a visual representation of ideas, often using colors and images. This can help to stimulate the creative part of the brain and can be used to organize thoughts in a more logical manner.

gap between theory and practice in innovation: Innovation always involves a change in perspective
The gap between theory and practice in innovation can often be a major obstacle to successful innovation. This problem is compounded by the fact that different fields of study have different methodologyologies and approaches to innovation. This lack of consistency is often the cause of failure when it comes to new product conception or business models. To break through this barrier, researchers typically adopt a methodological perspective, which takes into account the current state of knowledge in their field. In addition, practitioners need to adopt an innovative mindset, which means constantly seeking new ways to improve old products and services. The two sides of the innovation equation need to come together for a better understanding of how the product should be designed, what kind of customer service should be offered, and how much impact new ideas will have on older ones.
