Conclusion: The importance of big ideas
In any field, be it history or physics, there are certain big ideas that provide a framework for understanding the subject. In history, for example, the big ideas might include causes of historical events, or different interpretations of the past. In physics, the big ideas might include the laws of motion or the principles of energy.
Big ideas are important because they give us a way to make sense of complex information. They help us see the connections between different concepts and see how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Without big ideas, we would be lost in a sea of facts and data.

So next time you're struggling to understand a concept, ask yourself: what is the big idea? Once you have that, everything else will start to fall into place.
