What are the benefits of having big ideas?
Big ideas can have a number of benefits, including making you more creative, sparkling your thinking, and sparking new insights. Here are five reasons why having big ideas is important: 
1. You’ll be more creative: The more you think out loud, the easier it is for your brain to come up with new ideas. When you have big ideas in your head, you’re less likely to be stuck on something and more likely to come up with a solution that meets both your needs and the task at hand. 
2. You’ll be sparkier: If you can see what other people could do better than you, it will make it easier for you to come up with new solutions.

Definition of creativity: Come up with new and innovative ideas or concepts.
Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas or concepts. It can be found in many different realms, such as art, design, and business. In general, creativity is the process of coming up with new solutions to problems or making something new. For example, a creative artist might come up with a new way to represent a painting on canvas. A designer might come up with an innovative product that no one has ever thought of before.

Tips for Developing an Invention Idea: Brainstorming, Ideation, and Brainstorming Tools
When brainstorming, it can be helpful to have a variety of ideas floating around in your head. There are several brainstorming tools that can help you get started: ideation, brainstorming, and problem-solving. Some tips on how to use these tools effectively are as follows: 
1. Always have a notebook with you when you are brainstorming. This will help you keep track of all the different ideas that come up. 
2. Use different language whenbrainstorming. French is often used for brainstorms because it is easy to remember sounding terms and words. Other languages may also be used depending on the topic at hand. 
3. Brainstorm with other people. Often times, working on an idea alone will not produce the best results.
