What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals. You can find many different creative ideas online, and there are many ways to use them. Here are some of the best:  
- Creative packaging: Many people think that creativity comes when someone comes up with a new idea for a product or service. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes, creative ideas come from looking at something from a different perspective. For example, if you were to redesign your favorite restaurant’s logo, you might come up with an inventive design that is more eye-catching and efficient than the original. 
- Branding: One of the most important things that businesses do is to create brand equity. This means creating a name for your company and making it known to other businesses in your industry.

Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!
