What are big ideas?
What are big ideas? They are new and exciting ways of looking at things that may have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. Big ideas can come from anything – a new invention, a good idea for a product, or even a new way of thinking about something.
Some big ideas might just be something you've never heard of before – like the humble computer mouse. But others might be much more familiar - like traffic congestion or how to make school smarter. It all depends on what the big idea is, and what it could bring about in terms of change.

There are many types of big ideas – some more radical than others.

brainstorming: How do you start brainstorming?
brainstorming is a powerful tool that can lead to creative ideas. But it can also be difficult to start brainstorming. Here are four tips to help you get started: 
1. Make a list of the main ideas you want to explore. This will give you a starting point for your brainstorming sessions.
2. Take some time to think about what you want your brainstorming session to be about. What are the main topics that you want to cover? 
3. Get feedback from other people who will help you shape your ideas into a better idea. This can include fellow creatives, business owners, or other people in your industry. 
4. Use the tools that work best for you when brainstorming: paper, pencils, computers, or flashcards can all be used in different ways during a brainstorming session.
