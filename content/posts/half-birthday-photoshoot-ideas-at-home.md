The evaluation of creativity: There is no right or wrong way to evaluate creativity. However, there are certain things that are important to consider when judging whether an artwork is creative.
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. It is important to note that creativity does not have to be applied in a creative way. It can also be used in mundane tasks, like writing a paper or completing an online quiz. However, creativity is often thought of as a quality that comes from the imagination and free thought. A lack of creativity can lead to problems, such as when an individual cannot come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. In some cases, creativity can even be seen as a bad thing, as it can stop people from achieving their goals.

The Three Types of Ideas: What are they and how should you use them?
Ideas are a type of ammunition that can be used to improve a person's productivity, creativity and overall outlook. There are three main types of ideas: operational, problem-solving and innovative.
Operational ideas involve tasks that can be completed quickly and easily. These include things like fixing a car or getting the cat out of the dog's toy box. Problem-solving ideas involve taking several steps in order to find a solution to a problem. These include solving an equation for example, or figuring out how to make something work better. Inventive ideas involve coming up with new ways to do something, or finding an old way of doing something and adapting it to new circumstances.

In ideation, ideas are generated from scratch and can come from anyone, but usually comes from top thinkers in a company or industry. In production, these same ideas are put together to create a product or service that can be sold.
