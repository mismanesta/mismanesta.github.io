Protectionism: How has protectionism affected invention propagation?
Protectionism has had a significant impact on the propagation of invention ideas. Invention ideas often originate from a new perspective or idea that is not protected by current legislation. Protectionism can stop these new perspectives from reaching a wider audience, and it can also limit the number of products that can be created based on an idea.
