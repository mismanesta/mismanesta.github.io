The process of coming up with ideas: How does one go about coming up with ideas?
Ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they are just a jumble of thoughts that don't make much sense together, but other times they might be something that someone has been staring at for months and hasn't had the guts to say anything about.
