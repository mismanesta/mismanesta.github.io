The History of Innovation:
Innovation is the process of expanding the boundaries of what is possible. Innovation occurs when a new idea or approach to solving a problem is proposed, and then tested and implemented. There are many different types of innovation, but some common ones include:
1. Research and development – This refers to the development of new products or services that are Pirandello-like in their concept but with real world application possibilities. It can be done through trials and prototypes, as well as product launches.

2. Creative destruction – This refers to the process by which ideas, concepts, or technologies that have been tried and failed before are resurrected and given a second chance. They may be used in combination, or they may be abandoned altogether after experiencing negative results.
