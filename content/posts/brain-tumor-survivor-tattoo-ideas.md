Conclusion: The value of big thinking
In a world that is constantly changing, it is more important than ever to be able to think big. Big ideas are what drive progress and innovation. They are the engine of the global economy.
The ability to think big is not something that everyone is born with. It is a skill that must be learned and developed. There are many ways to do this, but one of the most effective is to read widely and to expose yourself to new and different ideas.

Idea 4: Write about a time when you created something new and loved it
When you're feeling inspired, your best bet is to focus on something that's new and exciting. Whether it's a new project or an idea you've had for a while but haven't put into practice, taking the time to start creating is always a good way to get ahead. Here are four creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with an old project – sometimes the most interesting things come from giving something up and starting from scratch. If you have an older project that you don't use as often anymore, give it a try again. Not only will it be more interesting and challenging, but you'll also have more experience and knowledge to work with.

2. Take on a new challenge – sometimes one of the best things about being creative is finding new ways to do things.
