Invention and Technology
Invention and technology have brought many benefits over the years, including making life easier and improving our quality of life. However, sometimes these advancements can be dangerous, leading to new ways of harming people or other animals. For example, scientists have come up with a novel way to reuse metal objects by using a heat treatment process to make them incredibly strong and durable.
