Defining creativity
In order to come up with creative ideas, one must first understand what creativity is. Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. It is often associated with art and music, but it can also be found in other areas of life such as problem-solving, business, and even personal relationships.
There are many different ways to define creativity. Some people believe that it is simply the ability to come up with new ideas, while others believe that it is the ability to execute those ideas in a way that is both unique and effective. Still others believe that creativity is a combination of both of these things.

Regardless of how you define it, there are certain things that are necessary for creativity to occur. These include a willingness to take risks, an open mind, and the ability to think outside the box.

Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods and technologies?
Innovation is a process of creating an new product, service or technology that is different from what has been done before. Innovation can bedefined as any change that makes something better or more efficient. Innovation can also bedefined as the ability to bring new ideas to market quickly and create value for customers. 
Traditional methods and technologies can also be called innovative, but they are not always the best options for how things are done. For example, a company might use a traditional way of doing marketing to get their product into peopleâ€™s hands sooner, but this approach might not be the best option when it comes to creating value for customers.
