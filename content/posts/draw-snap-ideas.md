Uses for inventions: What can you do with an invention?
Inventions offer a new way to do something, make a product or change the way we live. They can be helpful in many ways, from improving safety to solving problems we face every day. Sometimes an invention can be used for its own sake - like a new phone case that protects your phone - but other times an inventor might create an invention for a company or organization, hoping to improve their product or service. Here are some examples of how inventions have been used in the past: 
-An inventor created the first airbag system that saved lives on a highway in 1937.
-An inventor developed the global positioning system (GPS) in the 1990s so drivers could find their way around without having to look at Maps.
-Inventionists have created numerous devices and appliances since the turn of the century, such as solar chargers and anxiety pills.

Invention 3: a way to store food in the fridge without using plastic or airtight containers
According to scientists, there are three ways to store food in the fridge without using plastic or airtight containers. The first way is to use a fermentation process that breaks down the cellulose in plants into glucose and carbon dioxide. The second way is to use a vacuum sealer that sucks clean air out of the fridge and stores food in airtight containers. The third way is to use an oven as a warming oven that cooks food until it becomes safe to eat. all three methods have their own pros and cons.
