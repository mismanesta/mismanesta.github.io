Creative Ideas For You: What do you have in mind that you haven't thought of before?
Creative ideas can be anything you want them to be, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with creative ideas. First, think about what you want your idea to accomplish. Sometimes all it takes is a little creativity and inspiration to come up with something new and exciting. Second, make sure that your idea is feasible. If your idea doesn't have a lot of money or time put into it, it might not be worth your while to pursue it. Finally, make sure that your idea is funny or entertaining enough before you even think about pursuing it. These three points will help make any creative ideas more likely to become reality.

Economic analysis: What factors should you consider when developing an invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the seemingly simple to the incredibly complex. To make sure your invention is ripe for commercialization, you'll need to consider a variety of factors: cost, potential market demand, and other key considerations. Here are three tips to help you develop an idea that will be successful: 
1. Consider the costs of developing your invention. While it's important to come up with a reasonable price point for your product or service, don't forget about marketing and promotion costs – these can be significant expenses if you want your product to be successful. Look at how much money you think it would take to generate interest in your product or service and figure out how much marketing and promotional budget you'll need based on that information.

2. Consider potential market demand.
