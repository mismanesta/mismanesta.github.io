How to overcome creative blocks
If you're feeling stuck creatively, don't despair. There are a number of things you can do to overcome creative blocks and get your ideas flowing again.
One helpful approach is to brainstorm with someone else. This can give you some fresh perspectives on the problem you're trying to solve.

Another tactic is to take a break from whatever you're working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is some time away from the project to see it in a new light and have that breakthrough idea.

And if all else fails, there's always the tried-and-true method of just sitting down and forcing yourself to start writing or painting or whatever it is you're struggling with. The hardest part is usually getting started, but once you get going, the ideas will start flowing again.

Uses for inventions: What can you do with an invention?
Inventions offer a new way to do something, make a product or change the way we live. They can be helpful in many ways, from improving safety to solving problems we face every day. Sometimes an invention can be used for its own sake - like a new phone case that protects your phone - but other times an inventor might create an invention for a company or organization, hoping to improve their product or service. Here are some examples of how inventions have been used in the past: 
-An inventor created the first airbag system that saved lives on a highway in 1937.
-An inventor developed the global positioning system (GPS) in the 1990s so drivers could find their way around without having to look at Maps.
-Inventionists have created numerous devices and appliances since the turn of the century, such as solar chargers and anxiety pills.
