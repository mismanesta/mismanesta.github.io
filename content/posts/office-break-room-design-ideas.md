7 easy tips for improving your home's energy efficiency
If you're looking to improve your home's energy efficiency, there are a few easy tips to follow. Here are seven of the most common and effective ways to do so:
1) Use green heating devices – Green devices like home fans, incandescent light bulbs, and solar chargers can help reduce your home's energy consumption by up to 20%.

2) Ventilate your home regularly – When it’s hot outside, open windows and let the cool air flow through every room. This will help keep your house cooler and more comfortable all year round.

3) Add insulation – Insulation can greatly reduce your home’s energy bill. It helps keep drafts out, moderates temperature swings, and reduces noise levels.
