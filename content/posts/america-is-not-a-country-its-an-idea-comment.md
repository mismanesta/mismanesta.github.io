How can you create a big idea?
Creating big ideas is a key part of any business. Here are a few tips to help you come up with your best ideas:
1.Think about what other businesses have done and how they’ve done it. What are their strategies, methods, or processes? This will give you a lot to work with when thinking about your own business.

2.Create an outline of your business idea and then break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will help you focus on specific areas and make sure that each chunk is important for the whole business.

3.Make sure that your idea is realistic and achievable. If it seems impossible or like too much work, chances are you won’t even get started on it. Go with your gut feeling and see where the market takes you.
