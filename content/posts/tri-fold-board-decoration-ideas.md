What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from your ideas for a song to a way to improve the efficiency of your office. Sometimes the simplest things can make a big impact, and that's what makes creativity so powerful. So if you're looking for ways to turn your creative juices into new ideas, here are some great starting points: 
1. Try out different ways of presenting information. Not everyone is used to reading with an eye-level view, so try different methods and see which ones work best for you.

2. Invent something new or come up with an idea that's never been done before. There's nothing like taking on a challenge and seeing how well you can do it!

3. Take on a task that's currently too daunting or impossible for someone else.
