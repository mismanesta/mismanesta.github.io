What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new products, services, or ideas that are different from the ones that have been before. It can be called creative change, and it can happen in a number of ways: through product development (racting evidence to create a new product), market research (finding out what people want and need), or process improvement (making things easier or faster). Innovation is often about finding solutions to problems that people have never considered before.

Innovation is a constantly occurring event in the life of humans and technology. It has been a driving force in human progress for centuries and will continue to do so into the future. There are a number of potential new technologies that could have a significant impact on society and the economy. 
One potential technology that has the potential to revolutionize how we do business is artificial intelligence (AI).

What is a blog and why should you have one?
Blogging is a great way to share your thoughts, ideas and experiences with the world. It can also be used as a platform to connect with people from around the internet. Whether you're just starting out or have been blogging for awhile, there are some key things to keep in mind when starting a blog. Here are six reasons why you should start a blog: 1) You can use your blog as an outlet for your creative juices to flow; 2) You can use your blog as an opportunity to network with other bloggers and potential clients; 3) You can share your own content (blogs, articles, videos etc.) and generate traffic from Google Adsense; 4) You could create a blog and offer free or paid services such as website design, ad management or email marketing; 5) Blogging could help you build brand awareness - if it's well-done and targeted correctly!
