what is creative art?
Creative art is a process of creating something new, whether it’s a painting, sculpture, dance, or story. It’s about using your imagination to create something that didn’t exist before. 
Creative art can be therapeutic and can help you express yourself in a way that you might not be able to with words. It can also be a form of relaxation and can help reduce stress. 

Whether you’re a professional artist or someone who just likes to doodle, creative art is for everyone. So get out your paints, pencils, or whatever else you like to use, and start creating!

Invention and Technology
Invention has always been a key component of technology. From fire starters to jetpacks, invention has helped people get the job done. But what happens when an invention is too good to be true? In some cases, this is where companies find themselves in a predicament. For example, the iPhone was initially thought to be a hoax because its creators couldn't find any evidence that it existed. However, over time Apple became known for its innovative design and features. Similarly, the Internet of Things (IoT) is another area where inventions have led to innovation. By making it easier for devices to communicate with each other, IoT has opened up new possibilities for businesses and individuals.

Impact of innovation: What are the implications of new technology on society and the economy?
Invention ideas are changing the way we live and work. They can bring new ways of doing things, products or services to market that improve our quality of life or create new economic opportunities. However, as innovation increases, so do the potential implications it has on society and the economy. One key question is how these changes will impact workers, businesses and the public sector. Another is how best to manage and accommodate those changes.
The United Kingdom recently announced a £149 million investment in innovation research and development (IRD). This brings IRD into line with other European countries that have also placed emphasis on innovation as a key part of their growth plans. The UK is seen as an example of how businesses and investors can benefit from early adoption of innovative technologies. It also shows that there is still a great deal of interest in this type of investment in Britain.
