Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores).

The four types of creativity
Creativity is a complex and multi-layered concept that can be broken down into four main categories: visual, auditory, nonverbal, and cognitive. Each type of creativity has its own strengths and weaknesses.
Visual creativity is largely based on the ability to see things in a different way. This can be done through creative thought or observation, or by using one's imagination. Visual artists often use color to create unique designs or patterns.

Audio creativity involves creating sounds that are unique and appealing. This can be done through vocals, keyboards, guitars, or drums. Audio artists often use sound effects or rhythms to add interest and excitement to their work.

Nonverbal creativity occurs when people communicate their ideas through body language and facial expressions. Nonverbal artists often use eye contact, gestures, and vocal techniques to express their ideas.
