What are big ideas?
Big ideas are what get people thinking and sparking new ideas. By definition, big ideas are those that are difficult or impossible to imagine, but which offer a great potential for solving a problem. They can come from anywhere, in any field, and can range from the small to the large. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A new way to make money: This could be anything from starting a small business to developing a new technology.

2. A better way to care for your health: This could include things like finding a way to reduce your exposure to environmental toxins or developing more effective medical treatments.

3. A new way of transportation: This could include anything from building an electric vehicle to creating a flying car.

The history and definition of creative art: Creative art can be defined as any art which is created with the intention to communicate a message or create a piece that has a unique aesthetic.
Creative art has been around for centuries, and has gradually evolved over time. Initially, creative art was only used for religious or spiritual purposes, but as time passed it became increasingly common to see creative art used in everyday life. Today, creative art is widely accepted and enjoyed by all. There are many different types of creative art, and each has its own unique abilities and benefits.
One of the most important factors in determining whether or not creativity is present in any given piece of creative art is the artist’s intention. If an artist is simply trying to communicate a message or create an experience that is enjoyable, then their work will likely be considered creative. However, if the artist is trying to create something that is new and exciting, then their work will likely fall into the category of creative art.
