Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.

Barriers to Innovation
Innovation is key to success in any field, yet it can be difficult to come by. There are a number of barriers that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a lack of knowledge, and a lack of creativity.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. This can include both financial resources and human resources. If you don't have the money to invest in new ideas or the people to execute them, it can be very difficult to bring about change.

Another barrier to innovation is a lack of knowledge. If you're not aware of what's possible or you don't understand how things work, it can be hard to come up with new ideas. This is why education and research are so important for promoting innovation.

Finally, a barrier to innovation can simply be a lack of creativity.

Creativity in art: How can it be used?
Creativity in art can be used in a variety of ways, from creating new and original pieces to exploring old ideas and techniques. There are a number of different methods that creative artists use to express themselves, and it ultimately depends on what the artist is looking for. Some common ways to utilize creativity in art include:
1. Drawing inspiration from nature – often times, artists will take inspiration from things that they see around them or feel inside themselves. This can involve looking at photos or drawings as a way to start thinking about how they could create a piece based on what they see.

2. Experimenting with materials and techniques – many times, creative artists will try out new materials or techniques in order to see what works best for them.

Definition of art: What is the difference between art and creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas and concepts that are new or different from what has been done before. Art, on the other hand, is the creation of art. There are many different definitions of art, but one definition that is often used is "the activity of making something that appeals to the senses." So, while creativity and art can have different meanings, they both involve coming up with new ideas and concepts.
