The Power of Idea: How do we get the most out of our ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business and creativity. From businesses to creativity, ideas can be the key to success. Here are five tips on how to get the most out of your ideas:
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. Without a clear goal, it will be much harder to motivate yourself to work on it. define your idea in broad terms and break it down into smaller steps that you can complete easily. This will help you stay focused on the task at hand and avoid getting lost in the weeds.

2. Take a step back and ask yourself why you think this concept or product is necessary or valuable. Once you have a good reason for your idea, it becomes easier to focus on developing it further and writing marketability plans accordingly.

How to do brainstroming effectively
Picture a room full of people, all focused on one task. They are all working together towards a common goal. This is the brainstroming effect, or the power of team work.
The brainstroming effect works because people's brains are tuned to multi-tasking. When we're focusing on one task, our attention span is limited and it takes longer for our brain to process information. This can lead to confusion and a lack of focus.

However, if we switch our focus away from the task at hand, our brains are more likely to revert back to their normal processing speed and be more productive once again. In fact, science has found that when we switch our focus away from a task for just a few seconds, the speed of our brainstems activity decreases by 50%.
