Brainstorming Methods: Different ways to brainstorm invention ideas.
1. When it comes to brainstorming invention ideas, there are a variety of different methods you can use.
2. One popular method is called "brainstorming by association." This involves coming up with ideas by associating them with other words or concepts.
3. Another common method is called "freewriting." This involves simply writing down whatever comes to mind, without worrying about whether it makes sense or not.
4. If you're having trouble getting started, try brainstorming with a group of friends or colleagues. You may be surprised at how quickly the ideas start flowing when you're working with others.
5. Whatever method you choose, the important thing is to keep the ideas flowing. Don't worry about whether they're good or bad at first, just get them down on paper (or in a computer file). You can always edit them later.

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything â€“ a new way of looking at something, coming up with new ways to do something, or coming up with a new idea for a product. There are so many creative ideas out there that it can be hard to know what to choose from. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1) Get inspired by your surroundings. When you're looking for creative ideas, take in the environment around you and try to come up with some ideas for products that would reflect the atmosphere. 
2) Be open to change. If you're not sure what you want your product to look like, don't be afraid to experiment and see what different styles work well for you. 
3) Take time for yourself. It's important to spend time relaxing and focusing on your creativity instead of working on things that are taking up your time.

How can you create a compelling value proposition?
Creating a compelling value proposition is a critical part of any business. By understanding and addressing the needs of your target audience, you can create a product or service that offers value to customers. Here are four pieces of advice to help you create a solid value proposition:
1)Clarify what your product or service does that others don't. Define what your customers need and want, and make sure your offer encompasses this. If they don't know what it is, they're likely not going to want it.
2)Know who your target market is. A good way to identify this is by doing market research on yourself or your competition. Understand the unique needs of your target market and craft your value proposition around these goals.
3)Make sure the price is fair.
