Causes and Solutions: How can we improve our overall health by understanding why some things are causing us problems, and what can be done to fix them?

What are big ideas?
Big ideas can be defined in many ways, but one way is as the thinking that takes a larger than average perspective on an individual situation or event. These ideas come to mind when we encounter something unique or when we are brainstorming new ideas. Big ideas can help us see the best way to approach a problem, think outside the box, or come up with new solutions.
