Definition of creativity: How is it different from other forms of art?
Creativity is defined as the ability to come up with new ideas, or new ways of seeing things. It can be different in every situation, and it often depends on the person. Some people might call creativity "the power of the heart." Others might say that creativity comes from a feeling or attitude. It's important to remember that creativity is not just about coming up with new ideas, but also having the courage to experiment and try out different ways of thinking.

Definition of a big idea:
Big ideas are those that are so big and complex that they take up a lot of space in a piece, but are actually very easy to understand and implement. Some big ideas may be things like global warming, energy independence, or creating a more perfect society. Regardless of the complexity of the idea, it should be easy to understand why it is important and what could happen if it were implemented.

Methodology: How will we test and measure the results?
Testing and measuring the results is an important step in any business. It allows you to know how your product or service is performing and whether it is meeting your expectations. There are many different ways to test and measure the results of a business, but one common approach is to use surveys. Surveys can be used to measure customer satisfaction, abandon rates, and more.
There are a few factors you should consider when choosing a survey technique. For example, do you want to target specific demographics? Or do you want to gather data from a large number of people? Finally, will you be able to release the results publicly? If so, public Release Testing (PRT) may be the best technique for you. PRT allows you to release your findings as soon as possible after testing so that everyone can see what worked and what didn’t.

Innovation in science and technology: How do we get there?
Innovation is a process of making something new and better. It can come from technology, science, or anything else that can be improved. There are many ways to make things better, and innovation depends on the right approach.
There are two primary ways to improve innovation: through early detection and correction of problems, and by developing new approaches to old problems. Early detection and correction is essential for ensuring that innovative ideas aren't just abandoned, but brought to market quickly so people can use them effectively.

Developing new approaches to old problems is another important way to improve innovation. This allows for more efficient use of resources, which in turn helps spur growth in businesses and create new jobs. It's important to find the right way to tackle old problems so they can be solved efficiently.

Modern Inventions: The printing press, the steam engine, the automobile
Invention is often synonymous with progress. It is the engine of capitalism and the driving force behind scientific advancement. But what are the most important inventions of modern times?
The printing press was invented in the 15th century and it changed the world. It allowed for the mass production of books and other printed materials. This in turn led to a rise in literacy rates and an explosion of knowledge.

The steam engine was invented in the 18th century and it too changed the world. It ushered in the Industrial Revolution, which led to a dramatic increase in productivity and wealth.

The automobile was invented in the 19th century and it changed the world yet again. It made transportation faster, easier, and more accessible than ever before. It also opened up new opportunities for trade and travel.
