Thesis: There are a lot of new ideas out there, but what are the best ones?
The best new ideas come from a variety of sources, but some of the most promising concepts come from the fields of neuroscience and computer science. These two fields are providing researchers with innovative ways to study the human brain and provide insights into how we process information. In neuroscience, researchers are currently working on understanding how the brain functions and how it is changed by experience. This research could lead to new treatments for mental health problems and possible cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease. Meanwhile, in computer science, researchers are working on developing advanced virtual reality headsets and other gaming platforms that could revolutionize how people learn new skills. By understanding these two branches of research, scientists can develop better ideas for products and services that would be more effective or fun for users.

Ideas can also be the starting point for new ideas, or the idea behind something we’ve been thinking about for a while but haven’t had the courage to bring to life.
