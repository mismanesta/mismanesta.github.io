The Future of Invention: There is an active field of research that is exploring the potential of new technologies and how they could impact future generations.
Innovation is a constantly occurring event in the life of humans and technology. It has been a driving force in human progress for centuries and will continue to do so into the future. There are a number of potential new technologies that could have a significant impact on society and the economy. 
One potential technology that has the potential to revolutionize how we do business is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is able to learn and grow on its own, making it more efficient and accurate at performing tasks. This could have a significant impact on businesses, as it would make it easier to automate processes and reduce costs. 

Another potential technology that has the potential to have a significant impact on society is blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure transactions between parties without middlemen. This could have implications for many industries, including business, finance, and law.

The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.
