Invention as an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution
Invention has been around for centuries, and it is no secret that many creative minds have come up with brilliant new ideas. However, only a small percentage of inventions actually become products or services. This is due to the fact that invention is an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution. In order to make your invention successful, you must be able to come up with great ideas and have the hustle and determination to work on them tirelessly. If you are able to put in the extra effort, your invention will likely be more successful than those who just sit back and wait for someone else to create something for them.

Patenting an invention: What is the process of getting an invention registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office?
Patenting an invention can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it's also important to understand the process of getting an invention registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The first step is to come up with an idea for a product or service that you want to patent. You then need to create a patent application and provide ample detail about your invention. After all of this, you'll need to wait for the USPTO to review your application and decide if you'reeligible for a patent. If you're approved, you'll then have towait for your patent to be issued and start making sure that your invention is being used in commerce. There are many different ways that an inventor can get their invention registered with the USPTO, so it's important to speak with a USPTO representative about what specifically might work best for you.
