The Future of Healthcare: How will we keep our citizens healthy?
As we work to look into the future of healthcare, we must consider many different ideas. One idea that we could consider is having a system where citizens can access health care on-demand. This would mean that patients and doctors would be able to talk with one another directly, and would not have to go through a bureaucracy. Another idea is having healthcare vouchers which could be used to pay for medical services out of pocket. This would help ensure that people are able to get the best care possible while staying healthy. Other ideas include increasing access to mental health services, ensuring that everyone has access to quality education, and creating more affordable healthcare options.
