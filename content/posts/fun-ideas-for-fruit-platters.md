The benefits to creativity: How does creativity help us achieve our goals?
Creativity is frequently seen as one of the biggest benefits to having a creative mind. It can help you achieve your goals more efficiently and effectively, and it can also help you develop new skills. Here are some of the most common reasons why creativity is so beneficial: 
1. It can increase brainstorming and problem-solving abilities.

When you have a lot of ideas floating around in your head, creativity can help you come up with a solution that's more likely to work. And when it comes to problem-solving, creativity can be an asset – it's often better than relying on pre-determined solutions.
