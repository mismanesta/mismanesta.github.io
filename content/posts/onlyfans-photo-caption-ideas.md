What is the inventor’s story?
Invention Ideas are the stuff of legends and myths. What lies beneath their surface? For some, Invention Ideas may be something as simple as a new way to do something or a new product that revolutionizes how people live. However, for others, Invention Ideas may be something much more complex and amazing. These ideas come from within the mind of the inventor- often a creative thinker who has dreamed up a new idea for years but never had the opportunity to turn it into a reality. Inventors have an amazing story to tell and it often starts with one question: What if?

How can you create a compelling value proposition?
Creating a compelling value proposition is a critical part of any business. By understanding and addressing the needs of your target audience, you can create a product or service that offers value to customers. Here are four pieces of advice to help you create a solid value proposition:
1)Clarify what your product or service does that others don't. Define what your customers need and want, and make sure your offer encompasses this. If they don't know what it is, they're likely not going to want it.
2)Know who your target market is. A good way to identify this is by doing market research on yourself or your competition. Understand the unique needs of your target market and craft your value proposition around these goals.
3)Make sure the price is fair.
