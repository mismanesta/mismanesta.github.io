The bottom line: the benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are well-documented and undisputed. Brainstorming allows individuals to generate new ideas, build on existing ideas, and create solutions to problems. Brainstorming also fosters creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.
Despite the clear benefits of brainstorming, many people still hesitate to engage in this type of thinking. One reason for this may be the fear of judgement or criticism. Others may simply not know how to brainstorm effectively.

Fortunately, there are a few simple guidelines that can help make brainstorming more productive and less intimidating. First, it is important to suspend judgement during the brainstorming process.
