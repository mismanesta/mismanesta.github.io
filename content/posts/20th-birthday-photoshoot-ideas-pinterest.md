Creative ideas: How to come up with them?
Creative ideas are something that everyone has. Whether you’re a creative writer, artist, or just about anything else, creativity is always on the horizon. Here are 8 tips on how to come up with creative ideas:
1. Start with an idea and work from there. If you have an idea for a book, start by writing the first chapter and seeing what kind of feedback you get from readers. Once you have a feel for what works and doesn’t work in your book, then come up with some tweaks.

2. Get inspired by others. There are endless sources of inspiration when it comes to creative ideas! Look at paintings, sculptures, movies, TV shows – anything that inspires you in some way!

3. Take risks. When it comes to coming up with creative ideas, sometimes all it takes is a risk!

How to have big ideas
In a world where we are constantly inundated with information, it can be hard to come up with big ideas. But, having big ideas is essential for innovation and progress. Here are a few ways to have big ideas:
1) Be curious and ask lots of questions. When you're curious about something, you're more likely to come up with new and interesting ideas about it. So, ask lots of questions and explore the things that interest you.

2) Be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. If you're always open to hearing other people's opinions and considering different points of view, you'll be more likely to have your own original thoughts on a subject.

3) Take time to daydream and let your mind wander. Sometimes the best way to come up with big ideas is simply to relax and let your mind wander.

Patenting: How do you patent an invention?
When patenting an invention, there are a few things to keep in mind. One is the idea behind the invention - what is it? Another is the protection that is granted by law - what kind of protection? And finally, how do you go about getting these protections in place? Here are some tips for each: 
- Do your research: Before you file a patent application, it's important to do your research and understand the different types of patents available. There are many different ways to protect an invention, so don't be afraid to start fielding questions from potential patentees about what they can and cannot do. 
- File early: filed early will help get your application filed on time and protected as soon as possible. If you wait too long, other applicants may have already filed their applications, causing your application to languish in the Patent Office for years.
