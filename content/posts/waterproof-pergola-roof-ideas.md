The three Cs of creativity: Concept, Craft, and Color
Creativity is all about coming up with new and creative ways to approach a problem or achieve a goal. It can be found in everything from making art to designing costumes. In order for creativity to thrive, it needs two key components: concept and craft. Concept is the overall idea of what the piece will look like and how it will be used. Craft is the actual creation of the piece, from its conception to its completion. Finally, color is a critical factor in creating an effective work of art. By understanding these three components, creators can better focus on their creativity and produce pieces that are both unique and engaging.
