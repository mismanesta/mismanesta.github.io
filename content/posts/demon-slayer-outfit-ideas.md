What are some new ideas?
A recent report on the future of technology suggests that a number of new ideas are emerging for improving ways to connect people and create opportunities. One such idea is the use of robots to help with tasks that traditional humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as packaging goods, loading onto a truck, or cleaning. Another is the development of artificial intelligence (AI)powered assistants that can assist people with their day-to-day tasks, from booking appointments to grocery shopping. While these ideas may seem like small tweaks to existing workflows, they could have large implications for businesses and society as a whole.

The definition of creativity
Creativity is an intangible quality that many people seek to define. However, any definition of creativity must have at least one key component - the inspiration and motivation to produce something new. In today's society, creativity is often praised for its ability to inspire change, but it can also be used to create things that are commercially successful. The definition of creativity will change over time as more and more evidence is brought to light that creative art has a number of benefits beyond simply making people happy.
