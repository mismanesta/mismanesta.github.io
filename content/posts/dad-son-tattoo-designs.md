What are some creative ideas?
Creativity is something that everyone has in them. Whether it's coming up with new ideas for a project, or just coming up with new ways to see things, creativity is always a good thing. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1) Use color to bring life to your designs. Add a splash of color to any design and it will look more interesting and realistic. 
2) Think outside the box and come up with different solutions for problems. Remove the usual constraints and see how you can solve a problem in a creative way. 
3) Take risks and experiment with new technologies. When you're working on a project, it's important not to be afraid of making mistakes. risked experimenting with new technologies can lead to better results than simply following conventional wisdom.

The challenges of coming up with big ideas
In any creative endeavor, there are always challenges to overcome. Whether it’s coming up with original ideas or finding your voice in a crowd of others, creativity is always a work in progress. And while some challenges can be easily resolved (such as coming up with a great slogan), others pose more difficult obstacles. Big Ideas are one such challenge, and while they can be easy to come by (just look at any popular blog or online article on the topic), they often require time and effort to put together into a successful product or business idea.
Despite the challenge, big ideas make for great products and businesses. They represent an innovative new way of thinking that can encourage change and spur innovation. And while big ideas can take time and effort to develop into something successful, they’re worth the investment.
