Conclusion: Some ways to come up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas are aplenty, but sometimes they don't come easy. You have to be willing to think outside the box and come up with new ways to do things. Here are some ways to come up with creative ideas: 
1. Take on a new project: This can be something as small as creating a new design for your business cards or as large as starting your own business. It doesn't have to be anything that you're exclusively good at – it could be something that you're curious about and haven't tried before. Everything counts! 
2. Lead an experiment: One of the best ways to come up with creative ideas is to lead an experiment. This means starting off by thinking about what you're not doing and trying something different instead.

Innovation in the global economy:
The global economy is constantly improving, with new and innovative technologies regularly coming onto the market. This increase in innovation has helped to drive down costs and increase efficiency, making life easier for consumers and businesses alike. However, as the global economy continues to grow, some challenges remain. One such challenge is that innovation often doesn't always trickle down to lower levels of society - in some cases, it can eveneaturedin the top tiers of businesses. This problem is called "inefficiency": When innovation takes place at a high level and benefits only a few people rather than everyone around them, it's often difficult for others to access or use the same ideas. Inefficiency can also lead to problems for the global environment - when businesses don't take into account environmental impact when making decisions about products or services, they can contribute to climate change.
