However, innovation can also be a cost-effective way for businesses to increase their chances of success. For example, Google was founded on the idea that search engines could be improved so that people would find more information faster. By continually improving its search engine, Google became one of the most successful businesses in history. Likewise, Apple was once considered a startup company with little chance of success because its products were not innovative. But because it invested in research and development, Apple was able to create some of the most popular devices in history such as the iPhone and iPad. Innovation is essential to business success and can play a major role in helping companies reach new heights.
