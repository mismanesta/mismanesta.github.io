Regionalism: How does regionality play into the definition and appreciation of art?
Regionality has long been a defining factor for appreciation of art. The idea that art should be appreciated in its entirety, not just within a certain area, is something that has been debated by artists and critics alike.

Benefits of invention: How does an idea create value for someone?
Inventions can create value for their creators in many ways, from making a profit to improving the quality of life. But what happens when an invention is created by someone who has no idea what it will do?
