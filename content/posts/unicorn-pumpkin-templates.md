what are creative ideas?
A creative idea is an original thought or concept that has the potential to be developed into something tangible. It is often associated with innovation and creativity, and is often driven by a need or desire to solve a problem.
There are many ways to generate creative ideas, but some common methods include brainstorming, mind mapping, and using lateral thinking techniques. Once an idea has been generated, it is often important to incubate it, or let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. This can help to ensure that the idea is fully formed and that all potential avenues have been explored.

While there is no one guaranteed formula for generating creative ideas, there are certain things that can help to foster an environment where they are more likely to occur.
