Origin of Invention Ideas: How did people come up with invention ideas?
Invention ideas are often based on something that someone has seen or experienced. Invention ideas can also come from scratch, or from a combination of two or more different ideas.

What makes an invention idea particularly interesting is the potential for it to improve someone’s life or make a difference in the world.
