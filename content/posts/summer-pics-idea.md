The definition of creativity: What is creativity?
Creativity is an important word. It has been used to describe many different things in the past, but its meaning has changed over time. In ancient Greece, creativity was defined as making something new. This idea wasn't widely accepted by people at that time, but it is still used today. In the modern world, creativity is often used to describe how something can be done or how something can be created. However, there is no one definition of creativity. There are many different ways to think about creativity, and each person has their own definition. Some people define creativity as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others may think of it as the ability to see things differently orto come up with unique solutions to problems. Still others may believe that creativity isn't about anything specific but simply creative thought and problem solving.

How creativity impacts our lives
Creativity is a key factor that impacts our lives in many ways. Some say it’s the spark of inspiration that gets us going, while others say creativity comes from the willingness to take chances and work hard. Whatever the case may be, creativity has an impact on our lives in some way. 
For example, if you have a creative idea for a new product, you may be more likely to produce it if you are inspired by the prospect of making something new and different. Likewise, if you find yourself constantly searching for ways to improve your current work or business, then creativity may be one of your biggest assets. After all, it is through risk and experimentation that we learn how to create great things.
