The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.

Conclusion: How does brainstorming work? How do you come up with great ideas? What makes good ones? Is there a difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions?
In any business, brainstorming is a process that often helps to come up with great ideas. It can be used as part of an overall strategy or as a standalone tool. The most important thing is to find the right way to use it and to make sure it’s effective. There are two main types of brainstorming: formal and informal. Formal brainstorming typically takes place in a group setting and is focused on coming up with specific solutions to problems. In contrast, informal brainstorming can take place in your own time and can be more creative. It can involve anything from talking about your ideas with friends to simply coming up with your thoughts on the matter at hand. While there’s no one way to do brainstorming, using both forms will help you come up with more innovative ways to solve problems and come up with better ideas.
