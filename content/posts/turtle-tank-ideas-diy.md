The process of coming up with ideas: What tools do you need?
Ideas are hard to come by, but they're worth trying to get. There are a few tools that can help you come up with more ideas, but it takes time and effort. Here are some tips to help you get started: 1. Take some time for yourself. A lot of people think that if they just sit in front of their computer all day, they'll have great ideas. Unfortunately, this isn't always the case. If you need some time for yourself, go for a walk or take a bath; those activities will give you an idea of what's important to you and when you might want to come back to your work. 2. Get inspiration from others. People around you can be a great source of inspiration when it comes time to come up with new ideas.

Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.
