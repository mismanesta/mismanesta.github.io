Conclusion: the benefits of creative art
Creative art is often thought of as a luxury, something that only the wealthy can afford to enjoy. However, the benefits of creative art are not just financial; they are also emotional and mental.
Creative art can help people to express themselves in ways that they may not be able to do with words. It can also be a way to release bottled-up emotions and feelings. For some people, creative art is a form of therapy that helps them to deal with difficult life events or traumas.

The benefits of creative art go beyond the individual. When people create art together, it can help to build bridges between cultures and communities. It can also be used as a tool for social change, raising awareness about important issues such as environmentalism or human rights.

How to be more creative
Creativity is key to any successful career. If you can find ways to be more creative, your work will be more valuable and you'll be able to achieve your goals. Here are some tips on how to become more creative: 
1. Make time for yourself. When you're not working, take a break or do something that's outside of your regular routine. This will help you get away from the stress of the day and come back with fresh ideas. 
2. Take breaks when needed. When you're working hard, it's easy to get wrapped up in the task at hand and don't have time for anything else. However, when there's a break in between tasks, you can come back with new ideas and fresh perspective. 
3. Be open to change. Change is Key To Creative Processes!
