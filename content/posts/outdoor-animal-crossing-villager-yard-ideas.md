- Be patient: Don‚Äôt rush anything. Take your time and make sure everything you need is at hand before beginning the project.

Play: What is play?
Play can mean many different things to different people, and for some, it may be simply taking a break from work or life. To others, play may be something more communal, like exploring new neighborhoods or making new friends. There is no one-size-fits-all definition of what play means to someone, but the important thing is that it is an important part of who we are and what we enjoy.

What is creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be described in many ways, but one definition of creativity is "the power of the imagination." It can be used to create things that we never thought possible, or to come up with new ways to do things we've been thinking about for years. Some people say that creativity is what makes us human, and it's what makes us most creative.
