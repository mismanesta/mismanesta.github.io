What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.

Conclusion: the importance of creative art in our lives
It is safe to say that creative art is important in our lives. After all, it is one of the few things that can truly make us feel alive. It can inspire us, move us, and even change us.
Think about the last time you were moved by a piece of art. Maybe it was a painting, a song, or even a film. Whatever it was, it likely had a profound effect on you. Thatâ€™s because creative art has the power to touch our souls in a way that nothing else can.

Itâ€™s also important to remember that creative art is not just about entertainment. It can also be used as a powerful tool for self-expression and healing. For many people, art is a way to deal with difficult emotions and experiences. It can be a way to process trauma, express anger, and even find forgiveness.
