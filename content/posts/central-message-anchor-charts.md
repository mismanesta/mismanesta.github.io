What are some ideas?
Great ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with new ones. Here are some tips to get you started: 
1. Look for inspiration from your favorite movies and stories. While it can be difficult to come up with original ideas on your own, watching familiar films or stories can help you develop a feel for what might work well in the world of TMNT. 
2. Be open to new possibilities. Don’t be afraid to try something different or explore what might be out of your comfort zone. This will give you a wealth of ideas to consider when crafting new TMNT concepts and storylines. 
3. Take your time.

What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!

Here are some tips to help come up with great ideas:
