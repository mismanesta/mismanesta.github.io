Different types of innovation:
Innovation is a key term in business. It can be defined as the process of making something new and better. There are many types of innovation, some of which are more common than others. 
One type of innovation is product innovation. This refers to the development of a new product that does not already exist. In this case, the company must come up with a new way to make their product and market it to customers. 

Another type of innovation is process innovation. This occurs when companies improve the way they do something, such as developing a new manufacturing process or changing how they distribute products. Process innovations can have a big impact on the efficiency and profitability of businesses. 

Finally, there is service innovation. This refers to the development of new services that could not be produced by companies alone, such as software development or customer service.

Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but often left undefined. This creates confusion when discussing innovation and can lead to misunderstanding its true meaning. When speaking about innovation, one must first define it in order to have a common understanding of the topic at hand.
Innovation is typically defined as introducing something new, whether it be an idea, method, or product. However, this definition does not capture the full scope of what innovation entails. Innovation often leads to change, which can be either incremental or radical. Incremental change is small and gradual, while radical change is more significant and happens suddenly. Both types of changes are essential for innovation to occur.

There are many factors that contribute to innovation. One important factor is a company’s culture.

This includes people who are passionate about the subject matter, as well as people who can work together productively.
