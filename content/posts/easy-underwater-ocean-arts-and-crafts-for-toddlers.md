The benefits of innovation
Innovation is a key aspect of business success. It allows businesses to improve their products and services, and provides them with new ideas for how to do things. In addition, innovation can help businesses capitalize on new technologies and updates to their own infrastructure. By improving the way that they use technology, businesses can save money and increase efficiency.
Innovation is also a key factor in creating jobs. By making improvements to their products or services, businesses can create new positions for people who are capable of doing work that once required an advanced degree or experience. Innovation also helps businesses increase production by making changes to their plants or methods of producing goods. In turn, this can lead to increased profits and more jobs overall.

Ideas for Creativity: What works and what doesn’t
Creativity is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. However, it can be difficult to know what works and what doesn't. Here are some ideas for creativity that may work for you: 
1. Keep a journal or diary to help you keep track of your ideas and progress. This can be a great way to tape your thoughts and ideas together so that you can revisit them later on. 
2. Use creative software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to create digital illustrations, designs, or logos. These tools allow you to take your ideas and turn them into reality! 
3. Take on challenging projects that will force you to rethink your methods and strategies. This can include working on projects that are outside of your comfort zone, submitting original work to competitions, or simply trying something new once again!
