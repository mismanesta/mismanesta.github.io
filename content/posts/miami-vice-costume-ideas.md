The benefits of having Big Ideas.
There are a number of benefits to having big ideas, from increasing creativity and innovation to improving productivity and motivation. Here are four ways in which big ideas can help you achieve your goals: 
1. By definition, a big idea is something that is much larger than what has been done before. This can help you think outside the box, and allow you to come up with new and exciting ideas that may not have been possible before. 
2. Big ideas can also be more challenging than average, which can give you an opportunity to see how far you can push yourself and try new things. This could mean that if you’re looking for a project to work on that’s both challenging and innovative, a big idea might be the perfect fit for you.

Invention is the process of creating something new and using it to solve a problem. From making cigarettes to Facebook, humans have been using innovations to improve their lives for centuries. Today, scientists are still working to find new ways to make things better, and that's why innovation is such an important part of our economy. For example, the iPhone was invented by one man, Steve Jobs, and has helped turn Apple into one of the most valuable tech companies on the planet.
