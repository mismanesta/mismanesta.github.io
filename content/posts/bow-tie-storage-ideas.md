Invention inspired by nature: Why did people come up with new inventions based on nature?
Nature has always been a source of inspiration for new inventions. People have come up with new ways to do things based on natural phenomena for centuries. Some of the most famous examples include the wheel, the pyramids, and the light bulb. Today, we continue to see people come up with new ideas based on nature because technology has advanced so much since then.
