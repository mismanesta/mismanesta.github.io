Tips for starting a DIY project: What do you need before beginning?
There are a few things you need before beginning your DIY project. These include a level, a hammer, screws, nails, and an armoire. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Level the surface area of the work surface to ensure accuracy.
2. Choose a Hammer that is the Right Size for Your Project. A larger hammer will be more powerful and will take more time to smooth out the surface of the wood. A smaller hammer may have better speed but will leave more marks on the wood.
3. Nail The Work Surface To The Wall or Floor First. This will prevent mess and make it easier to handle your project later on when nails are needed.
4. Screw The Work Surface To The wall or Floor After You nail it down (If using a floor).
