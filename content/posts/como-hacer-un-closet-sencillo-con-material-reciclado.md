Types of big ideas:
There are many types of big ideas, but six are particularly important. These are called "big ideas for the future." They can help people develop a plan to improve things they care about in the present and create new opportunities for the future.
1. A universal health care system: This is a big idea that may seem complicated or impractical, but if it works it would be a huge step forward in improving our economy and reducing social unrest. It's not just a matter of getting everyone access to quality healthcare, though; it's also about making sure everyone has an equal say in decisions about what is best for them.
2. A world without weapons of mass destruction: Another idea that seems impossible at first glance, but if done correctly could havefar-reaching consequences.

A few Tips for Using Brainstroming to Improve Your Life
Brainstroming can help improve your thinking and productivity, especially if you're struggling with a specific problem or goal. Here are a few tips for using brainstroming to get started: 
1. Get organized: Brainstroming can help you focus on one task at a time, which can make it easier to succeed at your goal. Keep track of your thoughts and ideas in an easily accessible place, and use that information to jumpstart your brainstorming process. 

2. Take some time for yourself: Brainstorming is a great way to clear your head and come up with new ideas. However, don't work on your project for hours on end – set some limits and let the brainstorming process take its course.
