Definition of Innovation: How does it differ from other types of change?
Innovation is a change in the way something works, or an idea that leads to a new form of doing something. Innovation can be seen as a type of change in everything from food to technology. It's important to distinguish between innovation and other types of change, when trying to understand its impact. Innovation often requires more than one step, and can be difficult to control.

The Value of New Ideas: What are the benefits of using a new idea?
New ideas can be a valuable commodity when it comes to improving productivity and gaining new insights. They can also help change the way we think and operate, which can have big implications for our businesses and society. Here are five benefits of using new ideas:
1. New ideas can drive innovation. When a new idea is implemented in an organization, it can lead to increased creativity and innovation. This can help companies achieve their goals faster, as well as improve their products or services.

2. New ideas can provide fresh perspective. When a new idea is used in the wrong way or without proper context, it can sometimes result in negative consequences. A fresh perspective can help us see things from a different angle, which can result in better understanding and solutions to problems.

3. New ideas are contagious.
