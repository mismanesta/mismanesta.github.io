Effective ways to use creativity in your work.
Creativity is a necessary part of any work. It can be used to come up with new ideas, or to improve on current ones. Here are some tips on how to use creativity in your work: 
1. Take advantage of natural prompts: When you’re feeling creative, take advantage of whatever natural prompts come into your mind. For example, if you feel like a favorite book is inspiring you, try reading it while you’re working on something. This will help you get creative and come up with new ideas. 
2. Be flexible: If you find yourself getting stuck when it comes to creativity, don’t be afraid to change your approach. Just keep in mind that flexibility is key in effective work methods!
