Changes in the job market: 2019 predictions for the US economy
The job market continues to grow, with new jobs being created at a steady clip. But the future of the economy is still uncertain, as there are several possible trends that could affect the job market in the next few years. 
One trend that could have an impact on the job market is a rise in automation. This technology is slowly changing the way businesses operate, and as it does, many jobs will become obsolete or difficult to fill. As automation takes hold, many people may have to move into new positions, which could lead to increased unemployment rates. 

Another potential trend that could affect the job market in the next few years is a rise in wages. This increase may be due to factors such as better economic conditions and rising productivity levels. However, it can also happen as a result of negotiations between companies and unions over wages.

The Future of Employment: How will joblessness and automation impact employment?
As the world progresses, it is important to keep in mind that employment will continue to be a factor in society. This is especially true in the future as technology advances and joblessness becomes more widespread. One way that this could impact employment is through automation. Automation has the potential to reduce the number of jobs by making them more efficient and automated. Another implication of automation is that it could lead to people having less work to do. This could have a significant impact on society as a whole, especially if it leads to large numbers of people living in poverty.
