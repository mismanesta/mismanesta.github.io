The role of creativity in art: What does it mean for the artist?
Creativity is an essential part of the artist’s repertoire. The artist must be able to come up with ideas and concepts that are new and original, in order to express themselves through their artwork. Without creativity, artists would not be able to create pieces that convey their messages or share their experiences. Creative art can be seen as a way for the artist to process and reflect on their own emotions and thoughts, while also exploring new boundaries.

Types of innovation: What are some types of innovations that businesses commonly use?
Innovation is a process of change that leads to the creation of new products, services, or economy. There are many different types of innovation, but four common types are product innovation, service innovation, market innovation, and business model innovation. 
Product Innovation: Product innovations are changes in the physical form of something that makes it more accessible or useful to consumers. For example, Google created Street View in order to allow people to see how their cities look from close up. This type of innovation is often used for education and marketing purposes. Service Innovation: Service innovations are changes in the way services are delivered to customers. For example, Apple Watch was developed as a way for people to keep track of their time and step-by-step exercises without having to carry a phone around. This type of innovation is often used for health and fitness applications.

Creative artists: How many there are and what makes them special?
Creative artists are an often overlooked but important part of the art world. They come from many different backgrounds and have a range of different skills and techniques. Some are able to use their creative abilities to create beautiful or powerful artwork, while others specialize in specific genres or styles. However, all artists have something special that sets them apart from other artists. Here are four examples: 
Allison Bechdel is a well-known cartoonist who specializes in creation of humorous strips about female characters, which has made her one of the most recognizable and popular comic book authors of all time; performance artist Grant Wood created memorable posters and paintings during the Depression era that stand as benchmarks for American artistry; and David Stone Martin is known for his dramatic story-telling with his unique use of sound and light.

The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.
