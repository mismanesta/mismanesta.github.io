Examples: When can you use creative ideas in your work?
Creative ideas are great for your work. You can use them to improve the quality of your work, or to come up with new and unique ideas. Here are a few examples:
1. Use creative ideas when you need to come up with an idea that is outside the normal. For example, you may need to come up with an idea for a story that is different from what other people have written before.

2. When you have an idea that is not very clear, try using creative ideas to help make it more clear. Such as making the idea more concise, or adding images or diagrams to help explain it better.

3. If you have a problem with something that you are working on, try using creative ideas to help solve it.
