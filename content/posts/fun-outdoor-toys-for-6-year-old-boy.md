Overcoming the challenges of bringing a big idea to life
There are many challenges that come with bringing a big idea to life. The first challenge is often just getting started. It can be difficult to take that first step, but it's important to remember that every journey begins with a single step. Once you've taken that first step, the next challenge is often keeping your motivation high. It's easy to get discouraged when you encounter setbacks, but it's important to keep your eye on the prize and remember why you're doing this in the first place. Finally, another common challenge is maintaining momentum. It can be difficult to keep moving forward when you're feeling bogged down or burned out, but it's important to push through and keep your energy up. These are just some of the challenges you may face when bringing a big idea to life, but if you stay focused and committed, you can overcome them and achieve your goals.

The basics: how to brainstorm effectively
Brainstorming is a technique that can be used to generate new ideas for a project or problem. There are a few basic steps to brainstorming effectively:
1. Define the problem or goal. What are you trying to achieve?

2. Gather a group of people together. Brainstorming is usually more effective with more than one person.

3. Generate as many ideas as possible. The goal is to come up with as many potential solutions as possible, no matter how “out there” they may be.

4. Evaluate the ideas and choose the best ones to implement. Once you have a list of potential solutions, it’s time to evaluate them and choose the best ones to move forward with.

The science of creativity
A person's creativity is often thought of as a mysterious quality that cannot be measured or studied. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests otherwise. The science of creativity is an interdisciplinary field that examines the nature and development of creative abilities.
While there is no single definition of creativity, it is generally defined as the ability to produce new and innovative ideas. Creativity is often seen as a rare or elusive quality, but recent research suggests that it is more common than previously thought.

There are many different factors that contribute to creativity. Some of these include intelligence, genes, environment, and motivation. However, one of the most important aspects of creativity is divergent thinking. This is the ability to come up with multiple solutions to a problem or multiple ways to approach a task.
