Invention: How does invention change the world?
Invention has changed the way we live and work, and it could soon change the world again. With new methods of technology coming up every day, it’s hard to predict how innovation will impact our lives in the future. But with some careful planning, there is no doubt that invention will have a large impact on society as a whole. 
For example, imagine a world where cars were not relying on gasoline or oil to run. Instead, they would be powered by electricity or wind energy. This would slash fuel costs and improve air quality around the world. 

Similarly, imagine a world without farm animals. We would be able to produce more food without them and reduce water usage because we wouldn’t need to pour water onto fields just to get food for our animals. 

 Invention could also have an even larger impact on our planet.

Risks and Opportunities of Innovation
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of any business. It can bring new ideas and products to market, which in turn can save businesses money and increase sales. However, there are always potential risks associated with innovation. For example, innovation can lead to new technologies that are unproven or difficult to use, which could lead to errors or failures. Additionally, innovation can also lead to companies becoming too reliant on outside sources for their products or services, which could create conflicts of interest or problems with partner relationships. Overall, it is important for businesses to be aware of the risks and opportunities associated with innovation and make sure that they are taken into account when planning and conducting business activities.

Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.
