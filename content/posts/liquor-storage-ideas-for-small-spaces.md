Invention 3: a way to store food in the fridge without using plastic or airtight containers

The second way is to use a vacuum sealer that sucks clean air out of the fridge and stores food in airtight containers. The third way is to use an oven as a warming oven that cooks food until it becomes safe to eat. all three methods have their own pros and cons.

What is invention?
Invention is an act or process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. Invention has come from many different places, including science, business and creativity. Today, invention is used more often in technology than it ever has been before. 
Invention can be something as simple as making a new product or service or taking an idea and turning it into a reality. Sometimes invention comes from the simplest things- like coming up with a better way to chop wood. Other times, it takes longer but is more complex- like coming up with a new way to print money or create new ways to store information. 

But whatever the case, when someone comes up with an innovative solution, that’s something special. It shows they have think outside the box and are willing to try somethingnew just to see if it works.
