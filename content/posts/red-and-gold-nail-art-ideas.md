Research: How to do research to find inventions that can be used.
Invention ideas are a plentiful resource for businesses. The word “invention” can be used to describe anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. However, when it comes to invention research, there are key steps that must be followed in order to find potential products or services that could be used in business. 
One important step in finding inventions is understanding the target market. This means knowing what customers want and how they would use a new product or service. Additionally, it is important to understand the technology behind the product or service in order to create an idea for potential customers. 

Once an idea has been created, it is important to find someone who can test and market the product. This person can help identify any potential consumer problems and potentially create marketing materials that could be helpful in building sales.

What is brainstroming and why is it important?
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the phenomenon of increased focus and productivity during periods of intense thought or concentration. Brainstroming is often seen as a benefit to people who are able to keep their minds focused on one task for more than a short period of time. Some believe that brainstroming can be used to improve problem solving, creativity, and decision making. However, there are several caveats to note when it comes to brainstroming. First, brainstroming can be difficult to maintain for any length of time; second, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving maximal effectiveness; and third, individuals respond differently to different types of brainstroming interventions.
