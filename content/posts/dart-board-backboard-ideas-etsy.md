The Future of Work: How will work change in the future?
According to many experts, the future of work is one in which employees are able to work from home, commute less, and enjoy other forms of leisure. While these changes may sound like good news for workers, they also present some challenges. For example, if people are able to work from home while they have children or elderly parents around, this can lead to tension and stress at home.
