How can you develop big ideas?
Developing big ideas is one of the most important skills you can have as a businessperson. It's easy to come up with good ideas, but it's even easier to turn them into successful businesses. Here are three tips to help you develop big ideas:
1. Make a list of all the possible solutions to your problem. This will give you a range of options to consider when coming up with potential solutions.

2. Break your problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will make it easier to focus on solving each individual piece of the puzzle and creating a solution that meets your needs and goals.

3. Talk with other people about your idea.

The different types of innovation: Research, invention, development, and production
Innovation is a process of making something new or different. There are three main types of innovation: Research, Invention, and Development.
Researchinnovation is the most common type of innovation. It's when people study something and then make a change to it so that it can be used in the future. For example, in the medical field, researchers study diseases and then develop treatments to help people with them.

Inventionis when someone comes up with a new idea for something and then does something with it to make it work. For example, somebody might come up with a new way to make cigarettes that doesn't use tobacco smoke as part of their product. 

Developmentis when somebody makes an idea into a reality by creating a product or service that is usable by people.

What are some creative ideas?
Creativity is something that everyone has in them. Whether it's coming up with new ideas for a project, or just coming up with new ways to see things, creativity is always a good thing. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1) Use color to bring life to your designs. Add a splash of color to any design and it will look more interesting and realistic. 
2) Think outside the box and come up with different solutions for problems. Remove the usual constraints and see how you can solve a problem in a creative way. 
3) Take risks and experiment with new technologies. When you're working on a project, it's important not to be afraid of making mistakes. risked experimenting with new technologies can lead to better results than simply following conventional wisdom. 
4) Get inspired by others' work and learn from their mistakes.
