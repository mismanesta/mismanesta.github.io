The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any personâ€™s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.

Invention: The impact of invention on the economy
Invention has a profound impact on the economy. It could be said that without invention, there would be no modern day economy. Invention is the result of creativity and hard work, and it can have a significant impact on business and society. There are many different types of invention, but some of the most common are motorcycles, cars, laptops, and artificial intelligence. Each type of invention has its own unique benefits and drawbacks. For example, motorcycles are great for transportation because they're fast and easy to ride. However, they're not very good at getting people around in city streets or highways. Car manufacturers have been able to create more efficient cars by adding features such as automatic braking and air conditioning. This makes them much easier to use than other vehicles, but they also tend to be more expensive than others.
