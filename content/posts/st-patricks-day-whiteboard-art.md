Contributions of invention: What has been done with invention that has changed the world?

Development: How do you stretch an idea into a reality?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea that either solves an existing problem or makes a new one. This can be done in many ways, but the most common way to come up with an invention is through brainstorming. By doing this, you will get ideas for products, services, or even ideas for how to improve your business.
There are a few things you need to do in order to make an invention a reality. The first is to come up with an idea that has potential commercial value. Second, make sure that the idea is unique and canâ€™t be found on the market already. Third, find partners who are interested in developing and marketing the product or service. Finally, make sure that the product or service is easy and affordable to market and sell.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?
