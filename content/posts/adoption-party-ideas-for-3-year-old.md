Types of creativity: Intuitive, logical, creative, and gestural
Creativity is a highly subjective term that can be defined in many ways. Some might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is simply making something new. Whatever definition one chooses, there are some key elements to creative thinking which are all based on intuition. Intuitive thinking often comes from the subconscious and is not based on logical thought processes. This makes it much more difficult to control, but can also be very effective in solving problems or creating solutions.
