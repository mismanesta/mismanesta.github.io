Invention: How did one person come up with an idea that led to a new product or technology?
An inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for a new product or technology. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to cook food, or inventing a new alloy that can be used in metalworking. In some cases, an inventor may develop the idea while working on another project, and then take it further by working on the details until they come up with a product or technology that they think will be useful. Some inventors are also able to come up with ideas while they are away from their home country, or during off-hours at work.

Ideas can be a powerful tool for improving business efficiency, creativity, and overall productivity. By having more ideas, businesses can move faster and make better decisions when it comes to product innovation, marketing campaigns, and even store design.
