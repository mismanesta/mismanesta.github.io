The benefits of brainstorming
Brainstorming is a great way to generate new ideas, and can be done either alone or in a group. When brainstorming, it is important to suspend judgment and allow all ideas to be considered. This can help prevent “groupthink”, where people only consider ideas that are similar to what they already know. Brainstorming can also help people come up with creative solutions to problems.
There are many different ways to brainstorm, but one popular method is called “brainstorming by free association”. This involves coming up with words or phrases that are related to the topic at hand, and then using those words or phrases to generate new ideas. Another method is called “brainstorming by analogy”, which involves thinking of similar situations or problems and how they were solved.

Brainstroming is a mental process that helps to focus and organize thoughts. It can be used in both personal and professional settings. The process starts with identifying the main thoughts in your mind and then sorting them into piles or groups. From there, you can start to work on one or more specific tasks based on what you’ve assigned to those thoughts.
