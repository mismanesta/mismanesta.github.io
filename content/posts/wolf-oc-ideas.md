What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everywhere, and it's hard to know where to start. Here are some ideas to get you started: 
-Start with what you know. What are some things that you enjoy doing or have a special interest in? Try thinking of ways to combine those hobbies with your creativity. 
-Explore new creative routes. Once you know some creative methods, start exploring different ways of doing things. What works for one artist might not work for another, but there is always room for growth.

Trends for Work/Life Balance
In the next few years, many people are looking for ways to balance work and personal lives. Here are some ideas for ways to make work life easier for everyone: 1. Make work a non-essential part of your day. This means that you should only be working when it is necessary and from what you are best suited for. If you have time off during the week, use it to take care of yourself or do something that you enjoy. 2. Try using technology instead of avoiding it. Technology can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it also can keep you from getting too involved with work. Make sure to set boundaries so that your time on the computer is only used for necessary tasks and not idle chat or gaming. 3. Find a job that fit both your skills and interests.
