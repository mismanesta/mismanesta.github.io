Definition of creativity: How is it different from other forms of art?
Creativity is defined as the ability to come up with new ideas, or new ways of seeing things. It can be different in every situation, and it often depends on the person. Some people might call creativity "the power of the heart." Others might say that creativity comes from a feeling or attitude. It's important to remember that creativity is not just about coming up with new ideas, but also having the courage to experiment and try out different ways of thinking.

Idea 2: We need to create more opportunities for people to learn
There are many ways that people can learn new things. Some people learn through books, others through conversation, and still others through online resources. In order to create more opportunities for people to learn, we should consider creating more interactive learning experiences. These experiences could include:
-Teams: A team learning experience is a great way for students to work together and learn from one another.Team building activities can be used in a variety of ways, such asctoring lectures or discussing research papers with classmates.

-Video Lessons: Adding video lessons into classrooms can help students learn by watching it instead of reading it. This type of learning is convenient because students have time to stop and watch the lesson while they are working on other tasks.

-Blogs: Blogging can be a great way for students to share their ideas, thoughts, and experiences with others.
