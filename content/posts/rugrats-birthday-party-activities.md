History of invention: How has innovation been used throughout history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to create something.

2. One challenge is that people can get too caught up in trying to come up with the "perfect" idea, and as a result, they can become frustrated and discouraged.
3. Another challenge is that people can get too focused on one particular idea, and they may not be open to other possibilities.
4. The key to successful brainstorming is to keep an open mind and to try to generate as many ideas as possible.
