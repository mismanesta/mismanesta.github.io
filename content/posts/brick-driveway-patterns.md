brainstorming: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Whether it's coming up with new ways to market your company or coming up with new products or services, creativity is key. Here are a few creative ideas to get you started: 
1. unconscious brainstorming - This technique is when you come up with ideas without knowing why or how they'll help your business. Just think about what could work and then start thinking about ways to make it a reality. This can be fun because it can result in something that you never thought possible. 
2. using prototypes - A prototype is a version of an idea that's been created specifically for testing and feedback purposes. It can help you explore different aspects of your product before finally committed to making it a reality.

What are some ways to overcome them?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They can be inspiration or a way to take the next step. Here are three ways to overcome them:
1) Take a break: When it feels like you can't get started, take a break and come back with fresh eyes. With enough time, your new ideas will start to form and you'll be on your way to creating something great.

2) Get organized: Putting everything in one place will make it easier to focus on your project and won't leave any spaces for distractions. Keep track of what you're working on, where you want to go with it, and when you plan to finish so that you don't fall behind.

3) Talk to others: If you're feeling stuck, talking with other startups or experts can give you some great ideas and help get your project moving forward.
