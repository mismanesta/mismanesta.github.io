The power of big Ideas
Big ideas are the lifeblood of businesses and organizations. They can help change the course of history, create new products or services, solve difficult problems or change the way we live.
Here are four ways big ideas can help your business: 
1. Brainstorm new ideas with a group: With a few simple questions, you can generate dozens or even hundreds of potential ideas for your business. This way, you'll have a greater chance of coming up with something that will be interesting and innovative.
2. Test out new concepts: Once you've generated a number of potential ideas, it's time to test them out in an real-world situation. This means trying out different models, scenarios and models of how these products or services could work in order to see if they're actually feasible and profitable.
