The power of creativity: How can it help you succeed?
Creativity is a powerful tool that can help you succeed in any field. By using creativity, you can come up with new ideas and strategies that can help you achieve your goals. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when using creativity as a tool: first, be realistic about what you want to achieve. Don't expect to create something overnight or from scratch; rather, use creativity as an engine to help you realize your goals. Additionally, be sure that your creative ideas are feasible and achievable. If they aren't, you may find it difficult to implement them into reality. Finally, don't forget the importance of practice! The more time you spend practicing your creative processes, the better equipped you will be for anything that comes your way – whether it's creating new ideas or finishing projects.

Invention: How does invention change the world?
Invention has changed the way we live and work, and it could soon change the world again. With new methods of technology coming up every day, it’s hard to predict how innovation will impact our lives in the future. But with some careful planning, there is no doubt that invention will have a large impact on society as a whole. 
For example, imagine a world where cars were not relying on gasoline or oil to run. Instead, they would be powered by electricity or wind energy. This would slash fuel costs and improve air quality around the world. 

Similarly, imagine a world without farm animals. We would be able to produce more food without them and reduce water usage because we wouldn’t need to pour water onto fields just to get food for our animals. 

 Invention could also have an even larger impact on our planet.

Overcoming Writer's Block: What to do when you can't seem to come up with anything.
When you sit down to write and nothing comes to mind, it can be frustrating. Here are a few ideas to help you overcome writer's block and start getting your thoughts down on paper.
First, take a break. Sometimes when you've been staring at a blank page for too long, your brain just needs a break. Get up and walk around, do something else for a little while, and then come back to your writing with fresh eyes.

Second, try brainstorming. Get a piece of paper and write down whatever comes to mind, no matter how silly or unrelated it may seem. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can start narrowing them down and figuring out which ones you want to explore further in your writing.

Third, ask yourself some questions. What are you trying to say with your writing? What are you hoping to accomplish?
