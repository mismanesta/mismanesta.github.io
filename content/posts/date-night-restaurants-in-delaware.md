definition of innovation
One of the key concepts in innovation is the definition of what it is. Innovation can be defined as the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created.

For example, innovation can be used to describe the process by which new products are created, or the process by which new ideas are developed.

Another way is to test out products or services before they're released to see if they work well and if there's enough demand for them. There's also the option of learning from experts and watching them create innovative products or services.
