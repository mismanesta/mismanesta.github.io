In order to be more efficient and organized, it is important to have a plan. Here are some tips to help make your home more efficient and organized: 1. Make a list of all of your possessions - keep track of what you own and where you want it. This will help you keep track of what is belongs to you and where it is located.

Use common sense when organizing - think about things before moving them around or storageizing them. For example, if you have a refrigerator in one room, put all perishables in the fridge in that room instead of throughout the house.
