What are the trends for 2022?
The term "Ideas 2022" is becoming more and more popular as the year comes to a close. It is an umbrella term that refers to a number of different concepts and ideas that could have a major impact on society in the coming years. Some of the ideas include: 
1) Moving towards electric vehicles – A recent study by The National Academy of Sciences found that electric vehicles are growing more popular, with almost half of all Americans now owning one. This trend is likely to continue, as more people see them as an affordable and environmentally friendly option. 
2) Reducing income inequality – Another idea being discussed is whether or not to implement social welfare policies that help those who have less money than others. This could mean lower taxes for the rich, or increasing benefits for those who need it most.

The challenges of coming up with big ideas
In any creative endeavor, there are always challenges to overcome. Whether it’s coming up with original ideas or finding your voice in a crowd of others, creativity is always a work in progress. And while some challenges can be easily resolved (such as coming up with a great slogan), others pose more difficult obstacles. Big Ideas are one such challenge, and while they can be easy to come by (just look at any popular blog or online article on the topic), they often require time and effort to put together into a successful product or business idea.
Despite the challenge, big ideas make for great products and businesses. They represent an innovative new way of thinking that can encourage change and spur innovation. And while big ideas can take time and effort to develop into something successful, they’re worth the investment.
