The role of creativity in work: How does creativity impact productivity?
Creativity is a key factor in work. By definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas and innovations. This can be seen in everything from creative writing to product development. In today's economy, creativity is becoming more and more important as businesses strive to stay competitive.
One way that creativity can help businesses is by providingid→products or services that are not possible with traditional methods. For example, an idea for a new product could come from a brainstorming session where everyone comes up with different concepts. Once the product is developed, it could be marketed using creative ideas like creating slogans or marketing videos that are unique and engaging.

Beyond just products and services, creativity also plays an important role in team productivity. When people have access to fresh and innovative ideas, they are able to come up with better solutions faster.

The Structure of the article: What are your thoughts on the structure of an article? Are you thinking about writing a top 5 or 10 list, or doing a more traditional approach with each section)?
There are a lot of different ways to write an article, and the structure of an article is definitely one of them. The structure of an article can be broken down into four main categories: introduction, body, conclusion, and discussion. 
1) Introduction: This is where you introduce your readers to your topic and give them a brief overview. 
2) Body: This is where you start your story and tell your readers everything they need to know to enjoy the rest of the article.
3) Conclusion: This is where you wrap up your story and let readers know what you think about it. 
4) Discussion: This is where you have reader-led conversations in order to get feedback from them.
