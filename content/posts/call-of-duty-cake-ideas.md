Decorating: How can you make your home look its best without spending a fortune?
There are many ways to decorated your home without spending a fortune. You can buy new art or accessories or make your own decorations with materials you have on hand. Here are some ideas to help you get started: 
1. Decorate the walls with art. Paint the walls in different colors and designs, add pictures, or use products like spray paint to create an ethnic look. 
2. Use pieces of furniture that are not intended for living space and put them in places that will be used often such as the hallway or bedroom. This will give your home a more finished appearance without spending a lot of money. 
3. Add plants and flowers to your home in any way possible. Not only will this add decoration, but it also makes the environment more welcoming and stress-free. 
4. Get creative with window treatments and draperies.

The nine types of innovation: How do they differ and what benefits can they provide?
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas and concepts that can change the way we do things. It can come in the form of a new product, service, or idea. In some cases, innovation can also mean changing how we think about something. For example, when we think about innovation, we may remember Chuck Norris fighting aliens in a video game. However, this was actually an innovation that came from Capcom – they created a video game that allowed players to fight aliens without having to worry about theirGear. Another example would be Google’s invention of the computer mouse. This was an innovation because it allowed people to use computers more efficiently and effectively than ever before. There are many different types of innovation, but one of the most important types is creativity. Creativity helps us come up with new ideas and concepts that can change the way we do things.
