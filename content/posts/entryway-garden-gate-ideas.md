Idea 2: A way to track fitness progress and keep track of calories burned.
There are many ways to track fitness progress and calories burned, but one popular way is to use a pedometer. A pedometer tracks steps taken and the number of calories burned, which can be helpful in understanding how much exercise you're doing and how much weight you've lost. Another common way to track fitness progress is to use a Garminbrace. This tracking device records your physical activity data and stores it on a computer. You can then see your average caloric burn for each day or week, as well as your overall progress over time.

What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, product, or method. Invention can be found in everything from developing a new way to make a product to coming up with a new way to send information. Sometimes, invention is simply a good idea that someone has and doesn't have the time or resources to bring to fruition. In many cases, people become interested in invention after they come up with an idea that they believe could have potential applications.
