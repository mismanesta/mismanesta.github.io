The benefits of big ideas
Big ideas are the key to success in any field. By exploring and applying big ideas, you can realize your full potential and achieve great things. Here are a few tips on how to create big ideas that will help you throughout your career:
1. Make sure your ideas are realistic – don’t overthink things or hype them up too much. If your idea is unrealistic, it won’t be taken seriously and you’ll end up wasting time and energy on something that won’t pan out.

2. Be patient – take your time in developing your big idea and make sure it isn’t just a one-time project. As you develop it, make sure to keep track of the results so that you can measure how well it was received by the audience.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
